You choose to use greater dispel magic in one of three ways: a targeted dispel, an area dispel, or a counter.\r\n\r\n**Targeted Dispel:** This functions as a targeted dispel magic, but you can dispel one spell for every 4 caster levels you have, attempting a separate dispel check for each spell. Additionally, greater dispel magic has a chance to dispel any curse that remove affliction can remove, even if dispel magic can\u2019t dispel that effect. The DC of this check is equal to the curse\u2019s DC.\r\n\r\n**Area Dispel:** When greater dispel magic is used in this way, the spell affects everything within a 20-foot-radius burst. Attempt one dispel check and apply that check to each creature or object in the area, as if it were targeted by dispel magic.\r\n\r\nIf you don\u2019t specify spells and there is more than one possible spell on the target, your targeted dispel attempts to dispel spells at random. Magic items themselves are not affected by an area dispel but additional magical effects on them may be dispelled.\r\n\r\nFor each ongoing spell effect whose point of origin is within the area of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the result of the dispel check to dispel the spell. For each ongoing spell whose area overlaps that of the greater dispel magic spell, apply the result of the dispel check to end the effect, but only within the overlapping area.\r\n\r\nIf an object or a creature that is the effect of an ongoing spell is in the area, apply the result of the dispel check to end the spell that conjured that object or creature (returning it whence it came) in addition to attempting to dispel one spell targeting the creature or object.\r\n\r\nYou can choose to automatically succeed at your dispel check against any spell you have cast.\r\nCounter: This functions as countering with dispel magic, but you receive a +4 bonus to your dispel check to counter the other spellcaster\u2019s spell.", "brief_description": "", "requires_resolve": false}, "displacement": {"title": "Displacement", "level_requirements": ["Technomancer 3"], "school": "illusion", "casting_time": "1 standard action", "range": "touch", "area": "", "targets": "one creature", "effect": "", "duration": "1 round/level (D)", "saving_throw": "Will negates (harmless)", "spell_resistance": "yes (harmless)", "description": "The target of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location.

The image disappears when it is struck by an opponent, unless you cause the hologram to react appropriately. The image lasts for as long as you concentrate plus 3 additional rounds.\r\n\r\n**4th:** When you cast holographic image as a 4th-level spell, it produces a hologram as per the 3rd-level version of the spell, except the hologram follows a script determined by you.

The trigger can\u2019t\r\nbe based on some quality not normally obvious to the senses, such as alignment. The spell lasts until it is triggered, and then the hologram lasts for 1 round per caster level.\r\n\r\n**6th:** When you cast holographic image as a 6th-level spell, it creates a quasi-real, illusory version of yourself at medium range (100 feet + 10 feet/level). This hologram looks, sounds, and smells like you, but it is intangible. The hologram mimics your actions (including speech) unless you use a move action to direct it to act differently.

When traveling to a false destination, roll 1d20+80 to obtain results on the table, rather than rolling d%, since there is no real destination for you to hope to arrive at or even be off target from.\r\n\r\n**On Target:** You appear where you want to be.\r\n\r\n**Off Target:** You appear safely a random distance away from the destination in a random direction. The distance off target is d% of the distance that was to be traveled. The direction off target is determined randomly.\r\n\r\n**Similar Area:** You wind up in an area that\u2019s visually or thematically similar to the target area. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place within range.
