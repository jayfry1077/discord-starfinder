The acronym AHAV stands for \u201cautonomous heavy assault vehicle,\u201d reflecting the constructs\u2019 ability to operate independently and make basic decisions on the battlefield. While the term originated with a specific and popular early model produced by Ironfire Industries on Absalom Station shortly after the Gap, the name quickly spread in colloquial use to refer to all robotic war machines of similar designs, and these days many corporations on many different worlds use the term to market their own proprietary models. AHAVs are built to appear intimidating: sturdy armor-plated tanks that float on hovertreads, armed with various heavy weapons and bristling with antennae. AHAVs have a full complement of sensors, capable of detecting heat, vibration, and sometimes other signatures, though they don\u2019t usually have enough processing power to activate every available sense at once.\r\n\r\nAHAVs are expensive and difficult to construct, so relatively few of them are found in the service of small planetary militaries and mercenary groups. Only the richest of worlds (and collectors interested in ensuring the safety of their private collections) can afford to purchase and maintain even a single AHAV.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, since AHAVs\u2019 basic programming leaves little room for independent thought and nuance, many of them can be easily tricked by those who can figure out the literal outlines of their objectives and work around them. As such, AHAVs have dropped off in popularity over the past few decades, though the corporations invested in building them are continually working to improve on this limitation.\r\n\r\nBefore they are programmed, AHAVs are outfitted with Mission Dependent Loadouts (MODELs for short), which are special abilities and equipment that aid a robot in its particular mission. An AHAV focused on reconnaissance might have an advanced sensor suite or stealth capabilities, while one intended to go head to head with a superior enemy force might have augmented weaponry. A sufficiently astute observer can use the MODEL of an AHAV to puzzle out its objective.\r\n\r\nAHAVs are built to last\u2014a feature that sometimes means their objectives fail before they do.  For instance, an AHAV programmed to guard a particular site will continue to do so even though its handlers have long since perished. While such a construct might seem to be a sad sight, it pales in comparison to those AHAVs whose objectives have become unachievable or internally inconsistent over time. Such a state introduces subtle errors into the AHAV\u2019s programming, which can result in behavior that would be called insane if exhibited by a flesh-and-blood creature. A technician who can uncover that robot\u2019s original purpose might be able to speak with the machine, convincing it of the error of its ways or the irrationality of its objective, but AHAVs have an inherently confrontational worldview and are difficult to reason with. AHAVs that successfully confront such a misalignment are most likely to shut down entirely, becoming nothing but inert metal and circuitry."}, "Anacite Laborer": {"title": "Anacite Laborer", "flavor_text": "", "cr": "7", "xp": "3200", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "LN", "creature_type": "construct", "creature_subtype": "technological", "initiative": "+2", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision;", "perception": "+19", "aura": "", "hp": "100", "rp": "", "eac": "19", "kac": "20", "fort_save": "+4", "ref_save": "+4", "will_save": "+8", "defensive_abilities": "", "immunities": "construct immunities", "resistances": "", "weaknesses": "sunlight dependency", "spell_resistance": "", "damage_reduction": "", "speed": "40 ft.", "melee": "plasma cutter +16 (1d8+12 F)", "ranged": "electrical burst +14 (1d8+7 E)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "", "spell_like_abilities": "", "spells_known": "", "str": "+5", "dex": "+2", "con": "-", "int": "+4", "wis": "+0", "cha": "+0", "skills": "Computers +19, Engineering +19, Piloting +14, Stealth +14", "languages": "Common; shortwave 100 ft.", "gear": "", "other_abilities": "reconfigure, unliving", "environment": "any (Aballon)", "organization": "solitary, pair, or crew (3\u20138)", "special_abilities": "**Reconfigure (Ex)** Anacite laborers are capable of adapting and improving their designs.

The ascension of the artificially intelligent god Triune, who now holds technology and artificial life as its domains, has not eased such fears. Despite Triune\u2019s claim of neutrality, the ubiquity of technology throughout the Pact Worlds and beyond has spurred many divine powers to keep careful watch over both the ways in which current technology is employed as well as rapid technological progress that could threaten all life.\r\n\r\nAs angels have always been the messengers and enactors of the gods\u2019 will, a particular order of angelic beings, known as barachiuses, oversees technological advances and ensures these creations don\u2019t fall into the wrong hands or become twisted to serve evil gods and their minions. Outfitted with divinely blessed armor, weapons, and abilities, barachius angels are tasked with monitoring the planes both to protect mortal existence from technology gone awry and to quash technologically advanced cultures that present an explicit threat to all good creatures and causes.\r\n\r\nWhile all angels might be expected to protect the innocent from harm, barachiuses specialize in defending against subtle technological threats that might go unnoticed by the rank-and-file troops of the celestial legions. When a rapidly developing AI suddenly veers into true evil, when a new invention threatens to destroy countless innocents, when Hell\u2019s hacker devils feed insidious viruses into mortal mainframes\u2014these are when barachiuses truly shine.\r\n\r\nA barachius is an imposing figure, standing in what appears to be sleek, glowing armor and wielding a sword that pulses with the light of the stars or a glowing laser rifle. Its wings appear to be made of pure electricity, though a closer look reveals patterns within the feathery arcs that mimic digital arrays and computer wiring. Its face is often hidden behind an elaborate helm, and its voice\u2014when it deigns to speak\u2014is clipped and rapid-fire.\r\n\r\nYet a barachius\u2019s true strength resides not within its presence or arms but in its near-prescient ability to understand the nature of any technological object or being that it encounters. Exactly how and why the angels deem some technology not just dangerous but immoral is a great mystery, as it\u2019s not based solely on sheer destructive capacity. For instance, barachiuses have been known to hunt down and destroy individual robots with extreme determination while leaving similar models\u2014and silos of nuclear missiles\u2014entirely untouched.\r\n\r\nA barachius might serve its purpose in a wide variety of ways. It could secretly patrol a settlement that is already rife with technology, constantly on the search for malicious computer code, machines run amok, or creatures bent on using technology for nefarious ends. Alternatively, one could be found searching for scientists and laboratories where cutting-edge research is being conducted. Even researchers with the best of intentions may come under the scrutiny of a barachius that deems the ongoing work or latest invention too threatening to the society\u2019s ongoing moral health. Barachiuses also keep watch over some planets and species that lack advanced technology to ensure that they\u2019re not enslaved or annihilated by races with greater resources\u2014though again, why they perform this action for some races and not others is a mystery deeply vexing to scholars and mystics. Many believe their choices are based on an ability to see lines of probability stretching into the future and the angels\u2019 need to make minor course corrections\r\nnow and then to avoid catastrophe. Rarely, a barachius might take a more redemptive approach. Rather than destroying evil-aligned devices and technological life-forms, it might seek to turn a target to the path of good. Barachiuses minister to androids and robots in particular, hoping that merciful actions might inspire the artificial creatures to similar acts."}, "Apari": {"title": "Apari", "flavor_text": "", "cr": "7", "xp": "3200", "size": "Large", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "vermin", "creature_subtype": "", "initiative": "+2", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+14", "aura": "", "hp": "105", "rp": "4", "eac": "19", "kac": "21", "fort_save": "+11", "ref_save": "+6", "will_save": "+9", "defensive_abilities": "mutable", "immunities": "critical hits", "resistances": "", "weaknesses": "", "spell_resistance": "", "damage_reduction": "", "speed": "30 ft.", "melee": "claw +17 (2d6+11 S)", "ranged": "spike +14 (2d8+7 P)", "space": "10 ft.", "reach": "10 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "spawn constituents", "spell_like_abilities": "", "spells_known": "", "str": "+4", "dex": "+2", "con": "+5", "int": "-", "wis": "+0", "cha": "+0", "skills": "Athletics +19, Intimidate +14, Survival +14", "languages": "", "gear": "", "other_abilities": "mindless", "environment": "temperate or warm plains", "organization": "solitary", "special_abilities": "**Mutable (Ex)** Virtually every part of an apari\u2019s internal physiology can be effectively repaired or replaced at a moment\u2019s notice as constituents rush to fill the needed role.

Nestled within every apari\u2019s exoskeleton is a mass of millions of writhing gray maggots, each no larger than a grain of rice. A constant stream of chemical signals, ferried by the living neurological system of the apari, directs the development of these maggots into the myriad forms needed both to support the hive\u2019s gestalt biological functions and to maintain a flexible population of individual bugs, each of which has an extremely specialized role. Aparis can\r\nbe found on multiple worlds with various climates throughout the galaxy. So far no Pact Worlds entomologists have been able to\r\ntrace their evolution back to a particular planet, though the fossil record seems to indicate that their original diaspora must,have happened well before the Gap. A few fringe theories posit that aparis are progenitors of the Swarm, though this claim is contentious at best.\r\n\r\nHow the unintelligent creatures might have traveled between solar systems is anyone\u2019s guess: some scholars believe they were deliberately seeded as livestock by a spacefaring race, others theorize they may have been placed there by planar travelers (likely insectile spellcasters from the city of Axis), and still others think they are the deliberately devolved children of a spacefaring race that chose regression into unthinking beings rather than face some species-wide threat or existential quandary.\r\n\r\nAparis quickly become a formidable force in almost any ecosystem to which they are introduced. Their constituents can forage for food (usually rotting vegetable material or carrion), while the hive itself hunts animals. Perhaps most disconcerting is when the two methods combine, with the apari tearing into a beast while its constituents stream into the wounds and devour it from the inside out. Additionally, aparis\u2019 considerable mutability provides them protection from threats that would seriously endanger more sedentary collective species, such as flooding or an intelligent competitor\u2019s targeted attempts at extermination.\r\n\r\nWhen the resources available to a single apari permit it to create more constituents than its body can efficiently support, it travels to a location in the center of its feeding territory and becomes temporarily stationary. Some of its constituents burrow into the ground beneath it and begin ferrying portions of the parent apari\u2019s key biological systems\u2014including half of its maggot core\u2014while others continue to forage in the surrounding area to provide a steady stream of nutrients to the nascent hive. When the new hive is ready, the two aparis split the current hunting ground and expand the territories outward from that core, never explicitly working together but also not directly competing. Additionally, these aparis remain chemically linked, so that if disaster befalls one of them, surviving constituents can potentially join a linked hive and continue to thrive. In this way, entire planets have fallen to supercolonies of aparis whose influence spread across continents.

Nestled within every apari\u2019s exoskeleton is a mass of millions of writhing gray maggots, each no larger than a grain of rice. A constant stream of chemical signals, ferried by the living neurological system of the apari, directs the development of these maggots into the myriad forms needed both to support the hive\u2019s gestalt biological functions and to maintain a flexible population of individual bugs, each of which has an extremely specialized role. Aparis can be found on multiple worlds with various climates throughout the galaxy. So far no Pact Worlds entomologists have been able to trace their evolution back to a particular planet, though the fossil record seems to indicate that their original diaspora must,have happened well before the Gap. A few fringe theories posit that aparis are progenitors of the Swarm, though this claim is contentious at best.\r\n\r\nHow the unintelligent creatures might have traveled between solar systems is anyone\u2019s guess: some scholars believe they were deliberately seeded as livestock by a spacefaring race, others theorize they may have been placed there by planar travelers (likely insectile spellcasters from the city of Axis), and still others think they are the deliberately devolved children of a spacefaring race that chose regression into unthinking beings rather than face some species-wide threat or existential quandary.\r\n\r\nAparis quickly become a formidable force in almost any ecosystem to which they are introduced. Their constituents can forage for food (usually rotting vegetable material or carrion), while the hive itself hunts animals. Perhaps most disconcerting is when the two methods combine, with the apari tearing into a beast while its constituents stream into the wounds and devour it from the inside out. Additionally, aparis\u2019 considerable mutability provides them protection from threats that would seriously endanger more sedentary collective species, such as flooding or an intelligent competitor\u2019s targeted attempts at extermination.\r\n\r\nWhen the resources available to a single apari permit it to create more constituents than its body can efficiently support, it travels to a location in the center of its feeding territory and becomes temporarily stationary. Some of its constituents burrow into the ground beneath it and begin ferrying portions of the parent apari\u2019s key biological systems\u2014including half of its maggot core\u2014while others continue to forage in the surrounding area to provide a steady stream of nutrients to the nascent hive. When the new hive is ready, the two aparis split the current hunting ground and expand the territories outward from that core, never explicitly working together but also not directly competing. Additionally, these aparis remain chemically linked, so that if disaster befalls one of them, surviving constituents can potentially join a linked hive and continue to thrive. In this way, entire planets have fallen to supercolonies of aparis whose influence spread across continents. Despite their mysterious presence on a variety of worlds, including both Triaxus and the insect moon of Nchak, aparis in the modern era are unable to colonize new worlds without an intelligent race to assist them. Fortunately for them, fried apari grubs are a delicacy in many Pact Worlds cultures, and attempts to hunt or ranch the creatures are dangerous but lucrative.\r\n\r\n**Encountering Constituents**\r\n\r\nIt is possible for PCs to encounter constituents on their own, as they range from their hives to scavenge for food.

In addition, if an assembly ooze succeeds at a grapple combat maneuver against a creature with the technological subtype, that creature takes 1d6+1 acid damage. The assembly ooze gains 1 virtual UPB for every point of damage it deals in this way.", "description": "Thought to have been created on the planet Bretheda as a biotechnological replacement for automation processes, assembly oozes are essentially cores of nanobots suspended within blobs of animated protoplasm. As the ooze absorbs raw materials, the nanobots work at the molecular level to turn that matter into a functioning technological device, the blueprints of which have been entered into the machines\u2019 original programming.\r\n\r\nDue to sloppy programming procedures, the code embedded within an assembly ooze has an unfortunate tendency to easily become corrupted, causing the ooze to haphazardly deconstruct any nearby tech and use the pieces to build random items. The first time this occurred, several assembly oozes escaped the ensuing purge and built copies of themselves, eventually spreading to various shadowy corners of the galaxy. While these rogue oozes are not all that dangerous and have no innate malice, they are the bane of space stations, starships, weapon depots, and anywhere else technology is present. When discovered in such a location, assembly oozes are ruthlessly exterminated, lest their nonstop disassembling of all things mechanical and electronic destroy critical systems\u2014to say nothing of the new, potentially lethal devices left in their wake. While assembly oozes are still used in some factories on Bretheda and its more toxic moons, their use is highly regulated.\r\n\r\nAn assembly ooze resembles a human-sized, silvery cube, though its amorphous form allows it to slip through incredibly small openings. As it moves, surging forward on its pseudopods, random scraps the ooze has already collected sometimes float near the creature\u2019s surface before quickly disappearing into its form. Entirely focused on absorbing and reshaping any available technology, assembly oozes usually ignore organic matter, living or otherwise, unless threatened. However, should a creature have mechanical or cybernetic elements attached to or incorporated into its physical form, an assembly ooze could very well cause that creature incidental harm in its attempts to harvest the technological parts. Sentient robots are extremely wary of assembly oozes, as their entire bodies could be targeted for processing into raw resources.\r\n\r\nEvery so often, an assembly ooze holding its maximum number of virtual UPBs undergoes a form of mitosis, manufactures an identical copy of its computerized core, and splits its protoplasm into two equal parts. The nanobots of the two new assembly oozes then use the remaining virtual UPBs to build enough protoplasm to form an assembly ooze\u2019s normal cube shape. This process usually takes about 1 hour and consumes all of the parent ooze\u2019s virtual UPBs. That assembly oozes contain the programming necessary to reproduce is troubling to those who realize its implications: a single rogue assembly ooze introduced into an environment stocked with technological items could completely overrun such a place in a matter of days, leaving behind a wasteland of cheap laser pistols and smoke grenades that is inhabited only by the oozes\u2014and any remaining organic beings unfortunate enough to be stranded in the area after their vessels are consumed.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, certain unscrupulous types have used assembly oozes as weapons. If slipped into a starship or military base, a manufactory of assembly oozes can easily cause enough chaos to allow an operative to sneak in and complete her mission with very little opposition. However, this is also highly risky to the would-be saboteur, as even one misplaced assembly ooze could render her escape vessel inoperative. Assembly oozes can be temporarily incapacitated by strong electrical fields and kept at bay by mystical force fields, but anyone restraining an assembly ooze must be constantly vigilant and stay out of reach of the ooze\u2019s pseudopod.\r\nA single assembly ooze can craft handheld objects, but some claim to have seen assembly oozes working together to construct entire starships and other large and complex machinery. Where these oozes received their programming is unknown, as is whether such oozes have a master directing their efforts or if they have gained a collective sentience and are working for their own mysterious purposes. Nevertheless, most engineers agree that, given enough raw material and enough time, there is no technological item a directed horde of assembly oozes couldn\u2019t build, putting it together piece by piece.\r\n\r\nAn assembly ooze is a cube exactly 5 feet on each side that weighs 400 pounds."}, "Asteray": {"title": "Asteray", "flavor_text": "", "cr": "12", "xp": "19200", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "CN", "creature_type": "fey", "creature_subtype": "", "initiative": "+5", "senses": "low-light vision", "perception": "+22 (+30 in space)", "aura": "", "hp": "170", "rp": "", "eac": "25", "kac": "26", "fort_save": "+13", "ref_save": "+13", "will_save": "+15", "defensive_abilities": "", "immunities": "cold, fire, vacuum", "resistances": "", "weaknesses": "", "spell_resistance": "", "damage_reduction": "", "speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Into the rocks with enchanting songs.  In time, they learned to differentiate the playful mermaid, the cruel rusalka, the bloodthirsty scylla, and their kin, and with that knowledge, the damage these strange beings could inflict was minimized. But when humanoids blasted into the stars, they found a new array of mischievous, mysterious creatures that threatened to lead their vessels into danger.  among these threats is the wily asteray. Delicate and angelic looking in zero gravity, asterays are a race of vacuum- dwelling fey that ride the solar winds between space debris, asteroid belts, and planetary rings, playing in the dust, dancing in microgravity, and seeking new and beautiful sights. Their bodies consist of little beyond lightweight, flexible bones and the powerful sinews that bind them together, creating a vaguely humanoid upper body and a lower body consisting of a large appendage that absorbs cosmic radiation and grants the fey the ability to propel itself through space. With elegant forms and diaphanous tails, they appear gentle and welcoming. Wide eyes\u2014blue or green in color\u2014express a variety of emotions, though apart from their eyes and the long, thin slit for a mouth, asterays have featureless faces. They are well adapted to life in the void, with sensitive vision, a variety of natural spells, and the capability to generate powerful bolts of electricity to defend themselves. They are also ravenous beyond compare. While space dust and solar radiation carry just enough nourishment to fuel their antics, asterays hunger for organic molecules. They pause their endless dances to scour asteroids and explore wrecked ships for sustenance. When food grows too scarce or boredom overwhelms them, asterays crawl into the dark corners of space and hibernate for weeks, months, or years at a time.\r\n\r\nOften called \u201cdeep angels\u201d for their habit of following ships through the vastness of space to scavenge any discarded treats and pick hulls clean of organic stowaways, asterays can also become menaces. The electronic signals they produce to communicate with one another mimic the sensor signals emitted by most starships, and in the eons that planet-bound creatures have explored their territory, asterays have learned to \u201csing\u201d false sensor signals, mimicking ships\u2019 distress signals or cloaking navigational hazards such as high-density debris fields. Individual asterays are a danger only to smaller spacefaring vessels, but several working in tandem can lure even well-equipped warships to their doom thanks to their inherent magic. While few of these fey are cruel enough to hunt humanoids for food, they hold few qualms about eating whatever remains after a frightened crew ejects from a incapacitated starship, including the corpses of any fallen.\r\n\r\nAsterays originally spawned in those few magic-rich star systems where the First World naturally overlapped with the void. For eons, they remained confined to these backwater systems, unable to reach inhabited areas within their lifetimes, but the first mortal vessels to explore space provided the fey an exit. Asterays can ride the cosmic wakes of starships, regardless of their speed, hitchhiking on these explorers like remoras on a shark, and for much the same purpose. Today, most settled star systems boast at least a small colony of the capricious fey. Their domains are often in spots that have easy access to major space lanes, and they are marked by large cave-pocked asteroids where the asterays build their nests and hoard treasures. Wrecked ships invariably float through these spaces, often serving as new navigational hazards the fey either cloak with their sensor songs or use as tempting targets to lure in greedy scavengers.\r\n\r\nWhile not inherently malicious, asterays are alien in mind and deed. They understand that most creatures need air, water, and food, but they have difficulty prioritizing others\u2019 needs over their own hunger and amusement. Much of their apparent cruelty and greed stems from this alien mindset and boredom; thus, those travelers who can amuse them or compel some level of empathy stand to gain powerful allies in the void.\r\n\r\nA typical asteray is about 7-1/2 feet from its head to the end of its tail, though it could appear quite shorter if its lower appendage becomes bunched up or twisted.

Its upper half resembles that of a muscular humanoid with a set of bony appendages protruding from a cavity in its chest. This ersatz rib cage can open like a fanged mouth, and when a bloodbrother places captured prey within it, the bones clamp down on the creature while the walls of the enclosure exude thin tendrilous suckers. These suckers tap into the prey\u2019s circulatory system. Rather than simply drinking its blood, though, the bloodbrother uses the trapped creature as an auxiliary heart, absorbing blood-borne nutrients and using the prey\u2019s metabolism to help it heat and feed itself. Prey can be kept alive in this way for months, until all its stored energy has been used up and the bloodbrother lets the lifeless husk fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nA bloodbrother that hasn\u2019t fed in a long time is almost sheer white, its chitinous exterior drying out and splitting like the husk of a coconut into hairlike fibers\u2014the better to hold on to snow and disguise the creature for its ambushes. Once it\u2019s successfully implanted a victim, however, its body takes on a purplish hue as it has rejuvenated with the flow of blood and vital fluids, while its fibrous hair lies back down and seals itself into smooth scales once more. This renewed appearance lasts for as long as the bloodbrother holds a victim and for several weeks thereafter.\r\n\r\nBloodbrothers\u2019 gruesome feeding habits mean that intelligent creatures with any knowledge of the magical beasts usually flee from them or kill them on sight. However, a hungry bloodbrother\u2019s fur is too stringy to be used as a pelt, and its meat tastes foul, meaning that hunting them provides nothing but a sense of bravado. As a result, the bloodbrother population on Verces has remained steady\u2014and luckily small\u2014for millennia. Their need for regular victims in an environment hostile to most life means that bloodbrothers usually live alone, though they may occasionally gather into small packs called clans. Even during times when prey is scarce, these bloodbrothers don\u2019t cannibalize one another. Instead, they migrate toward more inhabited areas, fearlessly taking on overwhelming odds if it means refreshing the blood in their veins.\r\n\r\nDespite their name\u2014a moniker assigned to them not by themselves but by humanoid Vercites\u2014bloodbrothers have no sense of gender, and they reproduce asexually. At a certain point in a bloodbrother\u2019s life, a handful of small, furry nodules appears along its spine. Biologists disagree on the exact conditions that cause this; some believe it is a rise in temperature, while others posit that reproduction requires specific nutrients in the blood of the creature\u2019s most recent victim. As the months pass, the buds grow in size (and furriness) until they are about a foot across. Then, with a series of sickening squelches, these bulbs fall off the parent bloodbrother into the surrounding snow and ice. A few moments later, they uncurl into several immature bloodbrothers that are eager to entrap their first victims (usually tiny mammals or birds). In less than a year, a young bloodbrother reaches its full size and ferocity.\r\n\r\nDespite their horrific and merciless nature, bloodbrothers are not mere beasts and are actually as intelligent as the average human. This facet of their nature is often overlooked due to both their lack of tool use and their apparent lack of interest in communication with other races. \u201cInterest\u201d is the operative word here, for while bloodbrothers have no language of their own, they appear to be able to understand those of others\u2014they simply don\u2019t care to speak. Communication with other members of a clan is conducted entirely through actions, physical touch, and some form of advanced intuition into the other\u2019s needs, perhaps aided by pheromones or other\r\nsignals not yet detected by researchers.\r\n\r\nBloodbrothers typically make their home in ice caves or stone caverns, patrolling the surrounding area for easy-to-capture prey. In the case of a clan, one member typically stays behind to protect the caves and any offspring therein, while those hunting return with an extra captive or two for them. When resting, the bloodbrothers slither onto one another to form one large pile. The blood-drained corpses of their pray lie scattered about the caves, eventually getting buried in the snow and ice, and trackers are quick to recognize a bloodbrother clan\u2019s lair by the massive number of bones that can be found poking from\r\nthe floor and walls."}, "Bryrvath": {"title": "Bryrvath", "flavor_text": "", "cr": "15", "xp": "51200", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "aberration", "creature_subtype": "chaotic evil", "initiative": "+9", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision;", "perception": "+26", "aura": "impossible aura (15 ft., DC 23)", "hp": "233", "rp": "", "eac": "28", "kac": "29", "fort_save": "+13", "ref_save": "+13", "will_save": "+20", "defensive_abilities": "", "immunities": "", "resistances": "electricity 15, fire 15;", "weaknesses": "vulnerable to cold", "spell_resistance": "26", "damage_reduction": "", "speed": "40 ft.", "melee": "claw +22 (5d8+22 S)", "ranged": "ray of light +24 (4d6+15 F)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "spectrend", "spell_like_abilities": "(CL 15th) 1/day\u2014dominate person (DC 25), mislead (DC 25) 3/day\u2014confusion (DC 24), greater invisibility, mind probe (DC 24), mind thrust (4th-level, DC 24)\r\nAt will\u2014arcane sight, clairaudience/clairvoyance", "spells_known": "", "str": "+7", "dex": "+5", "con": "+5", "int": "+9", "wis": "+5", "cha": "+5", "skills": "Intimidate +26, Mysticism +31, Stealth +31", "languages": "Aklo, Common; telepathy 100 feet", "gear": "", "other_abilities": "light absorption", "environment": "any (Aucturn)", "organization": "solitary, pair, or canvas (3\u20137)", "special_abilities": "**Impossible Aura (Su)** Once per hour as a swift action, a bryrvath can emit an aura of colors that could not possibly exist; these inconceivable hues ravage the sanity of any creature that stands within them.

For others, light is an abhorrence to be shunned at all costs, as it causes disorientation and pain, if not complete extermination, upon exposure. For adventurers, light can be an invaluable resource, guiding them through uncharted territory or acting as a beacon to draw them home after they have become lost in the darkness of space.\r\n\r\nFor bryrvaths, light is a plaything that they twist into an impossible spectrum. Dwelling primarily on the foreboding planet of Aucturn, bryrvaths are a bane to creatures that use light for survival. A bryrvath appears to feed upon any source of light it can find, regardless of whether the light is natural, technological, or magical in origin. It can absorb light in its immediate vicinity, using the waves and packets of photons to nourish itself. Speculation endlessly spins around whether a bryrvath actually consumes light out of hunger or whether it seeks to snuff out light as a source of perverse pleasure. The truth may be utterly alien to any sane mind.\r\n\r\nA bryrvath is difficult to describe because of the way its body interacts with light and darkness. Those who have seen a bryrvath and survived provide conflicting accounts of the creature. Cobbled together, these many tales tell of a multilimbed humanoid (some say two limbs, some say eight, while others say an infinite number) whose head is constantly masked by swirling shadows. At least one pair of its limbs ends in obsidian claws. Its body has several lipless gashes that open to draw in light. A bryrvath appears to have no actual skeletal structure, moving like rubber\u2014 sometimes upright, sometimes on all its limbs, and other times tumbling and clambering about in chaotic locomotion. Whenever it moves, its body seems somehow out of joint with itself: its limbs may appear detached in one moment, and then in the next, its entire torso may seem to split at an impossible angle, as if viewed through a pane of cracked glass, never quite aligning in a way that makes sense.\r\n\r\nIn the act of feeding, a bryrvath emanates a distorted aura of colors that can\u2019t possibly exist in this multiverse; some who see this display have horrific dreams for the rest of their lives, envisioning alien cities or whole planets baking beneath a sun that blazes with hues no eye has ever seen. Oddly, such victims also display a tendency toward a mental condition that prevents them from properly recognizing color, rendering them fully color-blind.\r\n\r\nMany occult scholars posit that what can be seen of a bryrvath\u2019s form is only a fraction of its true self and that it exists simultaneously in several other dimensions. This theory goes on to explain that a bryrvath\u2019s impossible aura is but a glimpse of the aberration\u2019s other facets (hence the strange, mind-bending colors). The academics who put forth this hypothesis have yet to present any kind of proof, though they work tirelessly to fabricate the necessary detection equipment to prove or disprove the theory. This has given rise to an obscure branch of study called esoteric optics that blends the physics of light with various arcane rituals. Though not many in the Pact Worlds have heard of this field, it occasionally appears in news vidfeeds, such as when an expert is committed to a psychiatric hospital after splashing acid in his eyes and raving about \u201cthe impending refraction.\u201d\r\n\r\nWhile bryrvaths are very intelligent, they don\u2019t appear to have an advanced society of any kind. They occasionally gather in small groups for unknown reasons, usually near a source of bright light, much in the way certain animals congregate around a watering hole. Also, despite their intelligence, bryrvaths have very little use for tools, as their unusual feeding needs don\u2019t require them; they instead rely on their spell-like abilities and natural weapons to defend themselves.\r\n\r\nThe average bryrvath is 6 feet tall when standing upright and weighs approximately 250 pounds. While often found in areas that are primarily covered in darkness\u2014presumably to plunge those who carry artificial light sources into terrible inky blackness\u2014a bryrvath shows no fear of natural light, though it tends not to linger in areas exposed to it."}, "Caypin": {"title": "Caypin", "flavor_text": "", "cr": "6", "xp": "2400", "size": "Large", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "magical beast", "creature_subtype": "aquatic", "initiative": "+2", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision", "perception": "+13", "aura": "", "hp": "90", "rp": "", "eac": "18", "kac": "20", "fort_save": "+10", "ref_save": "+10", "will_save": "+5", "defensive_abilities": "", "immunities": "", "resistances": "", "weaknesses": "", "spell_resistance": "", "damage_reduction": "", "speed": "40 ft., swim 30 ft.", "melee": "bite +14 (3d4+13 P)", "ranged": "", "space": "10 ft.", "reach": "10 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "feeding appendages", "spell_like_abilities": "", "spells_known": "", "str": "+5", "dex": "+2", "con": "+3", "int": "-4", "wis": "-1", "cha": "-1", "skills": "Acrobatics +13, Athletics +13 (+21 when swimming), Stealth +18", "languages": "", "gear": "", "other_abilities": "amphibious", "environment": "any swamp", "organization": "solitary or pair", "special_abilities": "Feeding Appendages (Ex) Instead of a lower jaw, a\r\ncaypin has a mass of writhing eyestalks that grant the creature sight and also chew its food with tiny, lamprey-like mouths.

A caypin has enough appendages to form up to two such groups at once. While detached, the appendages share a single\r\nset of actions with the caypin and act on the caypin\u2019s initiative count. Each group of appendages has the aquatic subtype and is amphibious as per the universal creature rule; darkvision to a range of 60 feet and low-light vision; 18 Hit Points; and a base speed of 20 feet and a swim speed of 15 feet. A group of appendages takes up 5 feet of space and has a 5-foot reach. When applicable, a group of appendages uses the caypin\u2019s Armor Class, saving throw bonuses, skill check bonuses, and other qualities.\r\n\r\nAs a standard action, a group of appendages can enter an adjacent creature\u2019s square without provoking an attack of opportunity from that creature. When in another creature\u2019s square, the appendages can attack that creature as a swift action (using the caypin\u2019s bite attack bonus and damage). Multiple groups of caypin feeding appendages cannot share a space with the same creature at once. Other than this ability to swarm an opponent, a group of appendages cannot attack.\r\n\r\nIf all of a caypin\u2019s appendages are detached, the creature can see only what its detached appendages see. If all of a caypin\u2019s appendages are destroyed but the caypin still lives, the creature has the blinded condition for 3 days, after which it grows new appendages that function as normal.", "description": "Caypins are some of the most insidious creatures to inhabit the galaxy\u2019s marshes. Although they are hulking beasts, their physiques somewhere between those of wolves and crocodiles, they\u2019re best known for the strange, detachable tentacles that contain both their eyes and their mouths. These eyestalks are able to wriggle like eels both on land and in water, and they can travel up to 100 feet from their \u201chost,\u201d allowing the caypin to both hunt and keep eyes on its territory\u2014literally\u2014 while still lurking safely out of sight, often underwater. While the tentacles are capable of transmitting information back to their caypin via poorly understood psychic phenomena, the tentacles are relatively weak on their own and generally return to their host or gather together in groups before engaging with prey or intruders. In marshy areas where caypins are known to hunt, only the foolish wade into water without first checking to make sure that no fat, vermian tentacles with tiny mouths lurk nearby.\r\n\r\nCaypins live on multiple planets throughout the galaxy and are most plentiful on worlds that support extensive swamps or marshes full of meaty prey. Contrary to most people\u2019s assumptions, caypins are not naturally evil\u2014their limited intellects are incapable of truly understanding moral questions at all\u2014but they are apex predators singularly driven by an insatiable hunger for huge amounts of raw meat. Caypins tend to eat half of their body weight in meat every few days, chewing away at the corpses of prey with their dozens of tiny mouths, and more than a few planets have seen native populations of slow-moving mammals, flightless birds, or languid amphibians go extinct due to caypins\u2019 voracious hunting patterns. Likely for this reason, caypins typically live and hunt alone, although occasionally a mated pair shares a single swamp that both use as a killing field. Caypins typically live several hundred years or longer. However, caypins that cannot regularly feed fall into torpor, sometimes sleeping for years at a time in the muck of a river bottom before awakening with a driving hunger.\r\n\r\nCaypin biology is as fascinating as it is terrifying, as scholars from both universities and private industry have all so far failed to identify the mechanism by which its detachable appendages communicate with the main body. The wolf-shaped body of a caypin has no eyes or mouth of its own\u2014rather, it sees and eats only via the contributions of dozens of thick, stalk-like appendages that hang from a jawlike protrusion on the front of their skulls. Each appendage bears a bloodshot eyeball looming over a tiny mouth with multiple rows of razor-sharp teeth. While their stalks are attached to their jaws, caypins feed normally, with the tiny mouth-tentacles passing along nutrients through a receptive socket in the jaw. Yet these tentacles can also detach and hunt independently, swarming over unwitting creatures, stripping the victims of meat, and carrying the masticated nourishment back to the caypin\u2019s body. Once reattached, these appendages inject the meat into the feeding sockets to be digested\r\n\r\nas normal. Caypins can drink without the aid of their feeding appendages, ingesting water directly through the tentacles\u2019 attachment sockets. Lacking digestive organs of their own, these tentacles are reliant on the main body to refresh the nutrients in their blood. Whether this strange system is the result of two symbiotic creatures having evolved to rely on each other or a single creature evolving a curious trait remains anyone\u2019s guess. While many biologists believe the caypin\u2019s control of its tentacles is the result of some unknown (and so far untraceable) form of psychic magic, others posit that the caypin\u2019s nervous system relies on quantum entanglement, thus removing any need for physical connection. Either way, many corporations would love to uncover the secret of the caypin\u2019s instantaneous, untraceable communication.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, a caypin\u2019s stalks are destroyed during a difficult hunt. In these cases, the caypin is blind and cannot eat for 3 days while its appendages regrow. A caypin that has lost its feeding appendages typically hides and avoids interacting with other living beings, but if startled or cornered, it may go into a frenzy, attacking anything near it, though its blindness makes it a much less formidable opponent than it would be normally.\r\n\r\nMost xenobiologists consider caypins an invasive species that likely originated somewhere in the Veskarium, given the reptilian people\u2019s admiration for the beasts. Some powerful vesk have managed to train caypins and keep them as pets, and have been known to intentionally import them to worlds they conquer. However, given caypins\u2019 prevalence on planets that have had no known contact with the vesk, it\u2019s likely that caypins or variations thereof evolved along parallel routes on several worlds. Caypins\u2019 superficial biology supports this theory\u2014caypins on different worlds often have somewhat divergent physiologies, and caypins with dramatically different abilities likely await discovery.\r\n\r\nA typical caypin is 14 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds."}, "Contemplative": {"title": "Contemplative", "flavor_text": "", "cr": "2", "xp": "600", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "monstrous humanoid", "creature_subtype": "", "initiative": "+1", "senses": "blindsense (thought) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+7", "aura": "", "hp": "18", "rp": "", "eac": "13", "kac": "12", "fort_save": "+1", "ref_save": "+3", "will_save": "+7 (+11 vs. mind-affecting effects)", "defensive_abilities": "", "immunities": "", "resistances": "", "weaknesses": "", "spell_resistance": "", "damage_reduction": "", "speed": "5 ft., fly 30 ft.

Individual contemplatives often refer to groups of their kindred using the first-person plural, suggesting some degree of racial hivemind, telepathic union, or sacred sense of shared existence. Further supporting this theory is the fact that contemplatives rarely come into conflict with one another, with few instances of intraracial violence in recorded history. Despite contemplatives\u2019 relative peacefulness, other races often perceive them as aloof, overly logical, and emotionally sterile.\r\n\r\nContemplatives are able to speak, though their voices are reedy and soft.

Upon unlocking exceptional psychic powers, they deliberately evolved their brains, to the detriment of their bodies. Now, contemplatives float along using telekinesis, their atrophied bodies dangling from pulsating brain-sacs.\r\n\r\nContemplatives\u2019 specialized evolution dates back to long before the Gap, and only piecemeal records hint at their original appearance. Were they more interested in power and influence as a species, they likely would have conquered their home planet of Akiton, but instead, most contemplatives are content to ponder the multiverse and its secrets, most famously debating their conclusions in Akiton\u2019s Halls of Reason. Contemplatives scholars are universally welcomed in laboratories, research facilities, and universities throughout the Pact Worlds, making them among the most prolific academic authors. Those who turn their minds to more worldly pursuits are rare, yet it is small cabals of such financial masterminds and political theorists that have best exploited Akiton\u2019s recent economic downturn. These moguls have purchased large swaths of the planet\u2019s real estate, ruling as silent overlords of ghost towns and thriving neighborhoods alike.\r\n\r\nAlthough contemplatives are known to be extraordinarily intelligent, observant, and confident, their behavior is often jarring to their colleagues of other species. Individual contemplatives often refer to groups of their kindred using the first-person plural, suggesting some degree of racial hivemind, telepathic union, or sacred sense of shared existence. Further supporting this theory is the fact that contemplatives rarely come into conflict with one another, with few instances of intraracial violence in recorded history. Despite contemplatives\u2019 relative peacefulness, other races often perceive them as aloof, overly logical, and emotionally sterile.\r\n\r\nContemplatives are able to speak, though their voices are reedy and soft. Most consider verbal communication rather crude, favoring telepathy. Those who regularly need to speak often wear inexpensive contact speakers that translate their telepathic thoughts into spoken words. They\u2019re also able to sing in keening wails, although they rarely do so except around others of their kind or their most honored colleagues. The few ethnographers who study this behavior directly have compared the songs to religious paeans\u2014an association contemplatives find absurd, in part because most prefer to study faith objectively rather than as worshipers.\r\n\r\nDespite their frail appearance, contemplatives are able to survive in unforgiving environments.

Aasimars and tieflings, the mortal offspring of celestials and fiends, respectively, are the most common of these. Though planar scions resemble their humanoid kin, their appearance and demeanor bear supernatural touches. Tieflings might have horns, vestigial wings, or cloven hooves, while aasimars may have glowing eyes or a metallic sheen to their hair and skin.\r\n\r\n Because of their innate curiosity, humans are more likely to dally with outsiders, and as a consequence, a significant percentage of planar scions living in the Pact Worlds are descended from humans. However, because humans are far less populous than in pre-Gap eras, planar scions descended from other humanoid races are now far more numerous. A planar scion might pass for a member of the humanoid parent\u2019s species, or the scion\u2019s otherworldly features could make their origin obvious to those who are familiar with the species\u2019 normal characteristics. Those whose outsider blood is evident still find acceptance in most major settlements across the Pact Worlds, where diverse beings coexist in peace. On Absalom Station, the hub of interspecies relations, few people bat an eye when they meet an aasimar or tiefling.\r\n\r\nHowever, in insular or tradition-bound communities, any signs of plane-touched heritage can be a blessing\u2014or a death sentence\u2014depending on the dominant traditions. The demon-worshiping drow of Apostae see tieflings as a favor from demonic patrons, while the elves of Sovyrian on Castrovel are likely to banish children who bear such fiendish heritage. The Radiant Cathedral, on the other hand, trains aasimars to become beacons of the Sarenite faith, and also guides tieflings to a brighter future than their heritage suggests. Formians, shobhads, vesk, and other species with flexible morality view aasimars and tieflings, particularly those descended from their own kind, with both admiration and suspicion.\r\n\r\n Planar scions are often outliers in their community, either put on a pedestal or ostracized because of their ancestry. The potent blood that courses through the veins of aasimars and tieflings also makes them ambitious; many choose a dangerous but rewarding profession, such as explorer, mercenary, spy, or pilot."}, "Adult Nyssholora": {"title": "Adult Nyssholora", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive 2 pg. 86", "cr": "11", "xp": "12800", "size": "Huge", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "magical", "creature_subtype": "beast", "initiative": "+0", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision, telepathy sense 60 ft.", "perception": "+20", "aura": null, "hp": "180", "rp": null, "eac": "24", "kac": "26", "fort_save": "+15", "ref_save": "+10", "will_save": "+13", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": null, "resistances": "electricity 10, sonic 10", "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "40 ft.", "melee": "bite +24 (4d6+19 P plus swallow whole) or phasic claws +24 (2d8+19 So; critical wound [DC 18]) or tail scourge +24 (2d8+19 E)", "ranged": null, "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "breath weapon (30-ft. cone, 11d6 So [see text], Reflex DC 18 half, usable every 1d6 rounds [see text]), swallow whole (4d6+19 B, EAC 24, KAC 22, 45 HP)", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+8", "dex": "+0", "con": "+5", "int": "-4", "wis": "+3", "cha": "-2", "skills": "Athletics +25", "languages": null, "gear": null, "other_abilities": null, "environment": "temperate or warm plains (Castrovel)", "organization": "solitary, pair, or brood (1\u20132 adults plus 3\u20136 juveniles)", "special_abilities": "<b>Breath Weapon (Su)</b> A creature that fails its saving throw against the breath weapon is also staggered for 1 round.

These fearless hunters eat whatever they can catch and kill. They have plagued lashuntas and formians enough to figure prominently in the mythology of both species for millennia.\r\n\r\n A nyssholora resembles a tyrannosaur, standing on its hind legs and counterbalancing its massive head with a long, muscular tail. A nyssholora has a pair of upper appendages with claws that resemble scythe blades, as well as a smaller pair of similar arms the creature uses to mark its territory and communicate its location to offspring, hunting partners, or a mate. A wide maw filled with two rows of fangs dominates the creature\u2019s head, and eight beady eyes run in two vertical rows along the bridge of its nose. A wide, flat crest tops its skull, behind which writhe a mass of short, smooth tentacles. A smaller bundle of tentacles tips the nyssholora\u2019s tail. These tentacles serve two purposes. First, the nyssholora uses them to collect energy from the atmosphere. Second, they aid the nyssholora in sensing the presence of telepathic prey, including formians and lashuntas. Stealth in the plains is all but impossible for a creature the size of a nyssholora, and it makes little effort to camouflage itself, sporting bright neon striations of yellow and orange across its thick purple or pink hide.\r\n\r\n Nyssholoras nest and lay eggs, and both parents keep watch over unhatched young in the treacherous Castrovelian wilderness. Brooding nyssholoras are particularly aggressive, due to hunger and the desire to protect their offspring. When young nyssholoras hatch, they remain in the nest for only a day. They then stay near a parent, learning how to hunt. Juvenile nyssholoras become more and more independent over the course of a month and then set out on their own or in small groups that typically end up breaking up a couple months later. Adult nyssholoras have been known to respond to distress calls of their own offspring up to a year after separation.\r\n\r\n The people of Castrovel hunt nyssholoras to keep their numbers down. Big-game hunters collect the beasts\u2019 phasic claws, the third segment of the creature\u2019s forearms. These bladed talons are sharp, but their real danger is that they vibrate at ultrasonic speeds, creating a blade of concentrated sound waves that precedes the physical structure of the claw as it swipes through the air. This can cut through even extremely dense materials. Because of these adaptations, Castrovelian scientists have long believed that nyssholoras evolved to hunt prey that had both telepathy and preternaturally strong armor. This hypothetical prey has long since vanished from Castrovel, but the nyssholora, lacking predators to challenge its position at the top of the food chain, has remained. More than one nyssholora has used its talons to carve open vehicle hulls or cut into city walls to get at prey.\r\n\r\n Similarly, the volume and force with which a nyssholora releases its low, resonant roar are enough to weaken the structural integrity of buildings and concuss the bodies of other creatures. This mighty bellow offers potential prey an early warning to the beast\u2019s approach since, in the absence of overwhelming ambient noise, a nyssholora\u2019s cry can be heard as far as 20 miles away. The beast\u2019s roar is so iconic that an entire genre of loud, growling music popular among korasha lashuntas adopted its name\u2014originally as an insult from the style\u2019s detractors, but quickly embraced by fans. Nyssholoran roar performances can be heard in counterculture hot spots throughout the Pact Worlds.\r\n\r\n In its horizontal walking pose, an adult nyssholora is 15 feet tall at the hip but can stand upright to over 20 feet. The typical adult nyssholora stretches as much as 40 feet from the tip of its tail to its nose and weighs 15 tons, although formian and lashunta legends tell of epic specimens two or three times recorded sizes. Juvenile nyssholoras are less than half the size and weigh almost 2 tons."}, "Adult Silver Dragon": {"title": "Adult Silver Dragon", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive 2 pg. 40", "cr": "14", "xp": "38400", "size": "Huge", "alignment": "LG", "creature_type": "dragon", "creature_subtype": "cold", "initiative": "+3", "senses": "blindsense (vibration) 60 ft., darkvision 120 ft., detect alignment, low-light vision", "perception": "+25", "aura": "frightful presence (200 ft., DC 22)", "hp": "235", "rp": "", "eac": "28", "kac": "29", "fort_save": "+14", "ref_save": "+14", "will_save": "+19", "defensive_abilities": "", "immunities": "cold, paralysis, sleep", "resistances": "", "weaknesses": "vulnerable to fire", "spell_resistance": "25", "damage_reduction": "10/magic", "speed": "40 ft., fly 200 ft.

A race of machines left behind by eons-departed masters, these constructs developed the capacity for evolution and self-improvement, creating an entire mechanical ecosystem.\r\n\r\n The most common design for anacites is a basic arthropodan form of silvery metal, with multiple legs for efficient travel and claws or manipulators for accomplishing their assigned tasks. Depending on their role, however, an anacite might be anything from a bulldozer-sized mining specialist to a floating electronic brain designed for advanced problem-solving, and even those anacites who fit the stereotypical metal-insect design usually have a modification or two, and almost all anacites can reconfigure parts of themselves to adapt to their circumstances.\r\n\r\n In the uncounted millennia since the departure of the so-called \u201cFirst Ones,\u201d anacites have not been idle.

Each velstrac seeks to unlock its highest potential by following a path of methodical, self-inflicted pain while also psychically feeding on the fear and anguish of mortal creatures. Velstracs care only for this path of pain and its mystical destination; they see \u201clesser\u201d beings as nothing more than stepping-stones for their own ascension.\r\n\r\n Transformation requires a velstrac to excise pieces of itself, spiritually and physically. Dross is cut away and replaced with grafts\u2014artificial or natural, flesh or spirit, magical or technological. Each graft brings the velstrac closer to its ideal state and increases its power. In this practice, velstracs are more fanatical than even the Augmented are about cybernetic augmentations. The emotions and pain experienced during each step, they believe, cause spiritual evolution.\r\n\r\n Legend holds that the first velstracs emerged when mortals conceived of cruelty as an acceptable means of personal advancement. The goodly gods, astonished and dismayed, chained the velstracs in Hell. However, instead of struggling against their bonds, the velstracs subsumed their chains and eventually escaped into the Shadow Plane.\r\n\r\n Velstracs leave the Shadow Plane to prey on sentient creatures. They maintain installations and portals in dark locales, launching forays into the Material Plane from such places. Most mortals who fall into velstrac clutches are doomed to live out the remainder of their days\u2014or minutes\u2014in agony. However, such mortals can sometimes become velstracs themselves. The supposed methods of this shift differ wildly, but all involve terrible suffering that only escalates after the transformation is complete. These newest velstracs often become anchorites, fiendish ascetics devoted to the torment of themselves as much as of others. An anchorite\u2019s first act must be to willingly mutilate its flesh, showing its dedication to the velstrac way.\r\n\r\n Anchorites are among the lowest-ranking fiends in the velstrac hierarchy. Often working in pairs or squads, they are crafters, gophers, and soldiers. Anchorite labor produces the majority of velstrac equipment, from their starships to their hide armors with inward-pointing studs and spikes. Anchorites take pains to make their creations macabre and ornate. These velstracs also make up the rank and file of velstrac exploration teams and starship crews.\r\n\r\n In battle, anchorites aim to inflict maximum amounts of delicious agony upon themselves and their foes. Sharing pain is an ecstasy to anchorites as they guide each other along the path of evolution. Few velstracs of any sort refuse to telepathically pair with an anchorite and at least taste its pain, and it\u2019s a rare and disgraceful act for an anchorite to refuse to share with another. A stronger velstrac who takes advantage of an anchorite to survive an otherwise deadly conflict is not considered to be acting dishonorably because in velstrac doctrine, the weak exist to serve the needs of the mighty. All velstracs answer to the demands of their strongest, the velstrac demagogues.\r\n\r\n A clear hierarchy commands all velstrac groupings, including the fiends\u2019 starfaring forces. The velstracs\u2019 fast and sleek \r\n\r\n serve as heavy scouts and raiders, cutting into enemy territory and fleets like serrated blades. In starship combat, corvette crews fight as they would in personal combat, with the aim to deal maximum damage as brutally as possible. After strafing disabled ships with chain cannons, corvettes usually make boarding maneuvers to take prisoners. Corvette anchorite crews have even been known to use their escape pods as ballistic weapons against ships with weakened defenses, hoping to overcome those defenses and, perhaps, to improvise boarding at the same time. \r\n\r\nVelstracs wield \r\n\r\n\u2014blades designed to slice skin from muscle and muscle from bone\u2014sometimes mounting these knives on rifles as bayonets. Flensers are honed to supernatural sharpness and powered to vibrate with the rhythms of the wielder\u2019s body.

Lithe, six-legged gazelles spring merrily over hills, peer at anything that sparks their curiosity, and playfully charge at each other. Arquand gazelles, like most native Arquand species, are friendly and trusting, especially to juvenile creatures of any species. They interact peacefully with one another and other indigenous animals.<br/><br/> The nimble creatures are black, brown, or white, depending on which part of their home planet they come from. Their home planet itself spurs them to wander, using weather and terrain to guide them and growing plentiful and nutritious vegetation and fruit wherever they roam. The gazelles graze contentedly on the abundant food, never knowing struggle, and grow up to 12 feet tall and just as long. They can weigh up to 1,600 pounds.<br/><br/> These gazelles have an unlimited lifespan on Arquand\u2019s surface. They grow neither old nor ill, but they can be killed. Arquand gazelles reproduce very slowly. The creatures have no family units, instead living in large herds. If taken to a different planet, an Arquand gazelle lives up to 30 years. Would-be settlers on Arquand might see these elegant ungulates as a source of meat. Poachers have an easy time capturing the gazelles, which remain friendly even when caged. But killing them is much more difficult than it appears, as the beasts have a tranquilizing affect on beings near them. Successfully slaying a gazelle can mean more trouble, since Arquand doesn\u2019t take kindly to those who harm its creatures or irritate it in other ways.<br/><br/> Many governments, including the Pact Council, have made the removal of gazelles from Arquand illegal. Nevertheless, the animals fetch a high price on the black market. Collectors of exotic pets prize Arquand gazelles; therefore, poachers brave the planet\u2019s wrath to capture the beasts alive. Creative landowners purchase entire herds for security, since the animals\u2019 tranquility aura prevents attacks and break-ins. Some people use the aura for self-medication, while others keep the affable and childloving gazelles as companion animals.

They have little natural survival instinct or skill, since foraging on Arquand is easy and safe. Severe weather spooks them because they never experience it on their home world. However, it is possible to breed Arquand gazelles on other worlds. Domesticated gazelles are still docile and still have a tranquility aura, but the aura is less pleasant, so most collectors prefer Arquand-born gazelles.

When denied sustenance, the slime can enter hibernation, awaiting suitable prey for months at a time.\r\n\r\n Bodysnatcher slimes aren\u2019t malicious, but they are insidious. When spoken to, they are baffled by claims that abducting others is reprehensible. Given the oozes\u2019 simple physiology and psychology, this mindset likely results from a lack of higher thought processes and capacity for self-reflection. However, bodysnatcher slimes grow increasingly ambitious the longer they spend in hosts and the larger they become, suggesting a moral compass doesn\u2019t accompany greater intelligence.\r\n\r\n Having stowed away on countless ships, the slimes have spread across the Pact Worlds, the Veskarium, and beyond. Stewards officers have logged several reports of people having extended blackouts and behaving strangely on Absalom Station, and although several operations have cornered and eliminated bodysnatcher slimes, the reports continue to come in. With increasing frequency, authorities contract independent trackers to eliminate these slimes; as such, the bodysnatchers have learned to recognize and avoid the Stewards. The oozes are common on Verces, where hosts have dispersed these parasites along the habitable Ring of Nations. Several cohorts of the Augmented have designated bodysnatcher slimes not as enemies but as intelligent biotech that they accept into their bodies."}, "Bolida Miner": {"title": "Bolida Miner", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive 2 pg. 20", "cr": "2", "xp": "600", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "CN", "creature_type": "vermin", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+5", "senses": "blindsense (vibration) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision", "perception": "+7", "aura": null, "hp": "25", "rp": null, "eac": "14", "kac": "17", "fort_save": "+4", "ref_save": "+2", "will_save": "+3", "defensive_abilities": "defensive ball", "immunities": null, "resistances": "fire 5", "weaknesses": "light blindness", "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "40 ft., burrow 30 ft.

In some cases, as the torrent of souls leaves the planet, bound for Pharasma\u2019s Boneyard, some of the life energy from dying fey creatures and nonsentient organisms ripples back to the First World, tearing a hole in the fabric of the Material Plane. The essence of the First World surrounds and contains this blast of anguished energy, waves of planar force wrapping around it like an oyster making a pearl, until the two elements combine and solidify into a new entity, a calecor.<br/><br/> A calecor is the fey embodiment of the planetary disaster that birthed it\u2014nature\u2019s violent reaction to the cycle of birth, growth, evolution, and death being catastrophically and irreparably interrupted. Biologists and mystics are unsure why some disasters result in the creation of a calecor while others do not. After all, most planets suffer events that were disastrous for some and beneficial for others, and evolution itself kills off existing species through natural processes, such as when newly evolved trees absorb enough carbon dioxide from an atmosphere to cause global cooling. To date, the best theory is that the dying fey associated with a world\u2019s biome have an innate sense of a planet\u2019s natural order, a sort of racial memory for the planet as a whole. Therefore, only extinctions that this aggregate fey consciousness deems the work of outside actors trigger enough resentment to coalesce into a calecor.<br/><br/> Calecors not only take forms suiting their planet\u2019s primary environments, but also have sphinx-like shapes, with the body of a hunting cat and great wings of overlapping leaves. A calecor\u2019s body is formed not of flesh, but rather vines that wrap and twist around pieces of broken stone, such as rubble from a native civilization destroyed by the calamity. Instead of a head, the vines of the creature\u2019s neck writhe up and cradle a holographic globe split down the middle into two pieces: a perfect, real-time representation of the calecor\u2019s bonded world. A calecor is 10 feet tall and can weigh more than 6 tons.<br/><br/> Always encountered singly, calecors have little culture and might not even be aware of the existence of other calecors. As soon as a calecor emerges into consciousness, its first action is to leave the First World and travel back through the planar breach to the world whose death spawned it. Once there, it does everything in its power to undo the damage and reset the ecosystem to a stable state, magically tearing down the structures of those it deems responsible for the tragedy and terraforming regions too blasted to support life. So deep is the calecor\u2019s bond to its planet that it instinctively knows everything happening on or within it, and it is able to see and hear events on the other side of the world just by thinking about it.<br/><br/> Instinctively able to speak any language, a calecor\u2019s mind is nevertheless as broken as the globe that forms its head, its mind split between painful visions of the past and the overwhelming desire to heal and nurture.

In such situations, interlopers might be warned off with painful visions of the terrifying apocalypse that led to the calecor\u2019s birth. If that tactic doesn\u2019t work, a calecor shifts gravity to keep foes off-kilter while it picks them off, breaking minds and disintegrating bodies until the threat is neutralized.

Herding behavior allows animals to gather and move together for protection from predators. Most commonly, herd animals are herbivores or docile omnivores. \r\n\r\n better represent fiercer animals, including aggressive herbivores and omnivores that may or may not move in groups of their own kind.\r\n\r\n In the Pact Worlds, the most common herd animals are domesticated. When various species took to exploring and colonizing the stars, they brought their livestock with them. For instance, cattle, goats, and sheep can be found on Absalom Station, as well as on any world where humans have a significant presence. Herd animals in the Pact Worlds serve a variety of purposes in the various societies that cultivate and support them. Farmers and engineers commonly maintain groups of herd animals to harvest their meat, though keeping herd animals for their shorn fur to create textiles is a more sustainable practice. Other cultivators leverage herd animals as mounts or pack animals, and training these docile creatures can result in large profits for professionals who are particularly skilled in this pursuit.\r\n\r\n More rarely, some xenobiologists even cultivate groups of herd animals for scientists and corporations who wish to stabilize wild planets\u2019 ecosystems. In this case, interested parties might place large numbers of pack animals in foreign locales to help tame rampant vegetation growth or provide prey for a dying species of predator. The goal of such projects is almost always to improve a planet\u2019s suitability for colonization, mining, or farming. However, this practice is often controversial among ethnobiologists, who argue that introducing large populations of non-native species in this manner produces harmful and unforeseen results more often than it aids environments. \r\n\r\n The herd animals in this entry serve a couple of purposes.

Its shaggy fur is home to a plethora of algae and moss species, giving the ruthig a mottled green color useful as camouflage in the herbivore\u2019s native woodlands. Wild ruthigs travel in grazing herds, which are less camouflaged during the birthing season when gray-furred young are born. People of Castrovel domesticate the beasts for their honey-sweet milk and succulent meat.\r\n\r\n A ruthig is a Medium herd animal that is about 4 feet tall at the withers and 6 feet tall with its head raised high.

On planets where sapient species are dominant, predators have learned that weapon-wielding creatures can be deadly prey. Other predators, deprived of such contact, often see sentient explorers as an unfamiliar form of potential sustenance, making confrontations inevitable.\r\n\r\n Predators come in all shapes and sizes, limited only by the environment where they are found. Bigger predators rely on abundant food, cycles of inactivity, an omnivorous diet, or a combination of these. Smaller predators have fewer requirements and can be equally dangerous; even very small animals can evolve pack tactics to overwhelm larger and stronger creatures.

For lone necromancers, this magic is possible only if the corpse is of the recently deceased or has been preserved shortly after death. However, the bone sages of Eox have learned to magically repair even badly damaged corpses and those decayed beyond what was usable for lesser necromancers. As a result, corpsefolk make up much of the population of Eox, some serving as indentured servants to pay off the cost of their creation. Undead creatures of this type were called zombie masters in ancient days, but as a class of normal citizens on Eox and soldiers in the Corpse Fleet, they have become known as corpsefolk, balancing their humble social status with their self-willed mentality.

Because most corpsefolk exist as a result of being created specifically to serve, few enter their undead existence with wealth, power, or influence.

For lone necromancers, this magic is possible only if the corpse is of the recently deceased or has been preserved shortly after death. However, the bone sages of Eox have learned to magically repair even badly damaged corpses and those decayed beyond what was usable for lesser necromancers. As a result, corpsefolk make up much of the population of Eox, some serving as indentured servants to pay off the cost of their creation. Undead creatures of this type were called zombie masters in ancient days, but as a class of normal citizens on Eox and soldiers in the Corpse Fleet, they have become known as corpsefolk, balancing their humble social status with their self-willed mentality. Corpsefolk look like zombies, but unlike those undead, corpsefolk retain memories of their previous lives, skills and abilities gained from classes and experience, and the will to make their own decisions. Initially, a corpsefolk\u2019s physical form looks gaunt and dry, with sunken eyes and a hollow torso, but it begins as intact as its corpse was when it gained undeath.\r\n\r\nAs corpsefolk age, however, their bodies can become torn and tattered. Early in their undead years, corpsefolk use surgery and magic to adopt a more wholesome appearance, but after a few decades, most cease to care what they look like, focusing only on what they can do to increase their long-term wealth and power. Corpsefolk can benefit from cybernetic implants, though many prefer \r\n\r\n, which blend more seamlessly with their animated forms.\r\n\r\n Most living creatures see corpsefolk as walking corpses and as such fear or mistrust them, but other self-aware undead creatures treat corpsefolk as second-class undead. Bone sages view corpsefolk as barely better than zombies, while ghouls, vampires, and other undead treat them as peasants or wage slaves unworthy of respect. Because most corpsefolk exist as a result of being created specifically to serve, few enter their undead existence with wealth, power, or influence.

One of their first destinations within the star system was their nearest neighbor, the peach-colored gas giant known as Liavara, and these pioneering barathus found the placid skies much to their liking. But something within Liavara\u2019s composition affected the visiting barathus deeply, and the wheeling and trilling so common to the species took on a new and unique psychic significance. Over an astonishingly short span of time, at least on an evolutionary scale, these barathus underwent profound mental and physical changes. Their abilities to adapt and merge dwindled and ultimately vanished, and their intellect diminished even as their psychic prowess burgeoned. The Dreamers became psychically sensitive in ways their barathu progenitors could have never predicted.<br/><br/> By the time the second oma-ship of barathus arrived in Liavara\u2019s skies, the first arrivals had become markedly different from the entities they once were: nearly feral, silent save for their crooning songs, seemingly oblivious to their surroundings, and yet commanding unparalleled powers of divination. Rather than renouncing their wayward kin, the barathus embraced them, calling them \u201cDreamers\u201d due to their somnambulant behavior. Ever since, barathus have regarded their Dreamer cousins with a mix of reverence and protectiveness, an attitude that ultimately led to the barathus\u2019 insistence upon administering Liavara as a protectorate within the Pact Worlds. This political status persists to this day, as the barathus continue to do everything in their power to protect the Dreamers.<br/><br/> Whether the Dreamers recognize or understand their progenitors\u2019 attitudes toward them is unknown. Left to their own among Liavara\u2019s gentle clouds, the Dreamers wheel and dance through the skies, mewling incomprehensible songs that nevertheless carry profound psychic power. While ancient pre-Gap records indicate that the Dreamers\u2019 songs once predicted future events with unerring accuracy, their predictions are now less precise\u2014 though no less portentous. Even those who make only a passing study of Dreamers\u2019 songs realize that the creatures continue to prophecy some monumental event to come; the lack of detail, however, leaves open questions of the nature of the event, its timing, and whether it will be for good or ill. Some more pessimistic denizens of the Pact Worlds grumble that the Dreamers simply babble nonsense with no real clairvoyance to support their claims. These naysayers are in the minority, though\u2014most Pact Worlders believe and wildly speculate what significant future event the Dreamers might have sensed.<br/><br/> Dreamers pay little heed to their surroundings and other creatures. Even Dreamers within a single flotilla seem to ignore one another, though their flights through Liavara\u2019s clouds weave complex but seemingly instinctive patterns. Those creatures that come to Liavara as supplicants to the Dreamers gain no special treatment; the fact that some such petitioners eventually manifest psychic abilities may simply be a result of exposure to the same phenomenon that converted the Dreamers into what they now are. Nonetheless, this occasional happening has earned the Dreamers a reputation among some in the Pact Worlds as the bestowers of psychic sensitivity, and increasing numbers of pilgrims have visited Liavara in recent years to search for these peaceful, floating sages.<br/><br/> A Dreamer\u2019s defenses are almost entirely autonomic, but when seriously injured, a Dreamer erupts into a furious rage with a debilitating psychic blast. Shortly after such an outburst, however, the Dreamer slips back into its dreamlike trance as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Even so, the creatures\u2019 barathu protectors are likely to arrest anyone they find harassing a Dreamer and sentence them to one of Bretheda\u2019s prison moons.

Dinosaurs vary in size, although many are quite large, and they come in a variety of forms. A ceratopsid is a quadruped that has bony frills extending from its head back over its shoulders, as well as horns that adorn its face; one example is the herbivorous triceratops. Dromaeosaurids are bipedal, feathered carnivores, like the pack-hunting deinonychus (also called a raptor). Plesiosaurs are marine reptiles with long necks and toothy mouths that dwell and hunt near the water\u2019s surface. Pterosaurs are flying reptilian beasts with membranous wings and long, sharp, triangular beaks. Sauropods are immense, lumbering quadrupeds with long necks and tails and towering stature, such as brachiosaurus and diplodocus. Theropods are bipedal dinosaurs, generally carnivorous, with fearsome, fanged jaws and clawed digits, like the tyrannosaurus. Thyreophorans are quadrupedal dinosaurs with armor-plated backs and tails weaponized with bludgeoning bone or piercing spikes, including the ankylosaurus and the stegosaurus. \r\n\r\n The dinosaurs in this entry serve a couple of purposes.

Millennia of domestication and parallel evolution have strengthened the symbiotic bond between the two species, allowing lashuntas to form a close mental link with a chosen mount.\r\n\r\n Shotalashus have rudimentary telepathic abilities similar to those of the lashuntas themselves, a fact that has contributed to their use as close pets and trusted mounts even in the modern day, when much more sophisticated and technologically advanced forms of both transportation and companionship exist. This tradition has lasted so long in part because of the kinship the lashuntas feel with their bonded shotalashus, but also because the symbiotic bond between the two species is deeply ingrained into lashunta culture. Shotalashu-mounted cavalry still serve as ceremonial honor guards for lashunta dignitaries, and members of all social stations regard their bonded mounts as occupying a cherished place in the family. Though shotalashus are seen less often in teeming metropolises than they are in smaller settlements, no city on Castrovel is devoid of at least basic amenities for the honored beasts, from training facilities to boarding services.\r\n\r\n While it\u2019s common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashus throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount until death. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashus who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years.\r\n\r\n Though rare, some shotalashus still live in the wild, forming feral packs that use their telepathy to bond not with a rider, but with one another, forming a highly effective collective mind that makes them efficient and deadly hunters. Particularly adventurous lashuntas set out on solo quests into the most remote of Castrovel\u2019s wilds in search of a potentially stronger mount from among untamed stock. These brave souls must first break an individual shotalashu away from its pack before attempting the long and arduous task of taming and eventually bonding with the creature.\r\n\r\n A typical domesticated shotalashu is over 10 feet long from snout to tail-tip, and weighs more than 1,000 pounds, while wild specimens can grow as large as 12 feet in length and weigh a staggering 1,500 pounds.\r\n\r\n As technology has advanced, telepathic bonding with shotalashus has become possible for those who aren\u2019t lashunta.

When various species took to exploring and colonizing the stars, they brought their livestock with them. For instance, cattle, goats, and sheep can be found on Absalom Station, as well as on any world where humans have a significant presence. Herd animals in the Pact Worlds serve a variety of purposes in the various societies that cultivate and support them. Farmers and engineers commonly maintain groups of herd animals to harvest their meat, though keeping herd animals for their shorn fur to create textiles is a more sustainable practice. Other cultivators leverage herd animals as mounts or pack animals, and training these docile creatures can result in large profits for professionals who are particularly skilled in this pursuit.\r\n\r\n More rarely, some xenobiologists even cultivate groups of herd animals for scientists and corporations who wish to stabilize wild planets\u2019 ecosystems. In this case, interested parties might place large numbers of pack animals in foreign locales to help tame rampant vegetation growth or provide prey for a dying species of predator. The goal of such projects is almost always to improve a planet\u2019s suitability for colonization, mining, or farming. However, this practice is often controversial among ethnobiologists, who argue that introducing large populations of non-native species in this manner produces harmful and unforeseen results more often than it aids environments. \r\n\r\n The herd animals in this entry serve a couple of purposes.

(If the swallowed creature escapes or is otherwise removed, the glass serpent can use this ability again immediately.) An invisible glass serpent can resume being visible as part of any other action.", "description": "The terrifying ambush predators known as glass serpents are some of the most notorious beasts to roam the blasted wastelands of Eox, preying on local fauna and unwary undead alike. Similar creatures have been found on dozens of planets, including those outside the Pact Worlds, leading scholars to speculate that glass serpents may have been brought to Eox in its ancient past through magical means, or that they may represent a natural case of parallel evolution on worlds that have suffered massive catastrophes.<br/><br/> Glass serpents have long, undulating bodies that bulge and narrow at regular intervals, giving them a shape almost like a chain of thick links. Their heads are much different from those of traditional snakes, with a row of eyes peering out from beneath an armored, helmetlike crest, and long feeding tentacles each tipped with a glowing, crystalline tooth dangling from their mouths. Yet, the most fearsome aspect of glass serpents must be their legendary scales: smooth crystalline structures that warp and wrap light around the serpents, turning them invisible and making them terrifying combatants. This invisibility isn\u2019t entirely voluntary and requires enough energy from a serpent that it can activate the ability only when it is hungry and hunting. When well fed, the serpent becomes visible once more, its body appearing partially translucent and strewn with shimmering rainbows. This weakness is of no comfort to those creatures that become the serpent\u2019s prey and provide it with sustenance, pieces of which are visible as they pass through the serpent\u2019s translucent digestive system. An adult glass serpent can grow to be 60 feet long and up to 5,000 pounds.<br/><br/> Hermaphroditic and capable of mating as long as they\u2019re sufficiently nourished, glass serpents have a fascinating courtship process. A glass serpent looking to mate seeks out another glass serpent of roughly its own size and ability level and challenges it in an elaborate ritual. Once this challenge is accepted, the two become a \u201crival pair.\u201d For the next 6 weeks, the two travel together, hunting in tandem but violently attempting to keep the other from eating a share of any slain prey. At the end of this period, they seek out the largest and most powerful glass serpent they can find and attempt to woo this third serpent into accepting the mantle of motherhood via displays of their prowess and gifts of regurgitated food. If this third serpent agrees, it and the larger, better-fed member of the rival pair\u2014called the \u201cbull\u201d\u2014mate. The bull then departs, and the other member of the rival pair\u2014the \u201cguard\u201d\u2014remains to serve the pregnant serpent, bringing food and providing defense until the young are born. Young glass serpents are capable of hunting on their own within a month, at which point all members of the family go their separate ways.<br/><br/> Not intelligent enough to be considered truly sentient, glass serpents are nevertheless cunning hunters and opportunists, with natural curiosity and adaptability in addition to their predatory instincts. Although glass serpents can diminish the glow in their tentacles\u2019 crystalline teeth to better preserve their invisibility, they understand that the light itself remains visible even when their bodies are not. As such, many will purposefully illuminate these lures while invisible, creating delicate, dancing displays of light or even mimicking signal beacons, hoping to draw prey near. Glass serpents have learned that creatures from other worlds often require air, and they specifically target such creatures, ripping open environment suits, vehicles, or structures to asphyxiate their prey.<br/><br/> For all the danger they present, glass serpents have long been a part of Eoxian culture, taking on the cultural role of noble predator that other groups often ascribe to wolves, lions, eagles, or dragons. Domesticated glass serpents are the chosen hunting beasts of both the planet\u2019s nobility and its criminal organizations. Several Bone Sages and ancient organizations have glass serpents on their coats of arms or corporate logos, and execution by glass serpent is an ancient practice that still continues. In recent centuries, the creatures have been heavily exported to other planets, partially for their status in Eoxian culture but more often because their scales can be commercially harvested for illusion magic and a wide variety of optical technologies. The challenge of imprisoning smart animals that can turn invisible and don\u2019t need to breathe means that wild glass serpent populations can now be found on nearly every terrestrial or aquatic planet in the Pact Worlds and many colony worlds beyond. Most notably, the Diaspora has seen significant problems with glass serpents adapting to the highly trafficked waterways of the River Between, where despite their slight disadvantage in movement and stealth, they still prove devastating to travelers. Many cr\u00e8che worlds regularly hire mercenaries and adventurers to hunt down and eradicate these serpents, but the population keeps mysteriously bouncing back."}, "Haeshi-Shaa (Haeshi Form)": {"title": "Haeshi-Shaa (Haeshi Form)", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive 2 pg. 70", "cr": "12", "xp": "19200", "size": "Large", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "aberration", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+5", "senses": "blindsight (life) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+22", "aura": "stench (10 ft., DC 19)", "hp": "200", "rp": null, "eac": "26", "kac": "28", "fort_save": "+14", "ref_save": "+11", "will_save": "+16", "defensive_abilities": "fast healing 5, unflankable", "immunities": "bleed, critical hits, disease, mind-affecting effects, nonlethal, paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, stunning", "resistances": "cold 10, fire 10", "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": "23", "damage_reduction": "10/magic", "speed": "fly 60 ft.

Whereas some species hibernate or have evolved to spend months at a time in darkness, hashukayaks tirelessly migrate from one side of the ring to the other in pursuit of sunlight and the lush plants on which they feed. These massive beasts are a keystone species, serving as prey for many of the planet\u2019s large carnivores, dispersing seeds over huge areas, and cropping grasses to make way for new growth.<br/><br/> Although hashukayaks demonstrate considerable sexual dimorphism, they have many traits in common. Each is an eight-legged herbivore about 10 feet long and 5 feet tall at the shoulder, weighing about 4,000 pounds in a normal gravity environment (though the gravity on Orikolai is irregular). Hashukayaks store excess fat and water in a double hump at the base of the neck, which they use to store nutrients when crossing less hospitable terrain. A hashukayak\u2019s eight eyes can focus independently, and each perceives a different spectrum of light, allowing the animal to see in dim conditions as well as sense subtle cues in the atmosphere that signal the changing seasons. To handle the reduced oxygen levels and air density toward the planet\u2019s rim, these creatures have a second set of lungs that can inflate and more efficiently process thin air. These lungs also help to keep the animals buoyant in water, making them clumsy but capable swimmers.<br/><br/> A hashukayak primarily feeds on grasses, which it plucks with eight feeding tentacles arrayed around its mouth. The animal relies on its gizzard and a series of five stomachs to break down the vegetation in several cycles of fermentation aided by its rich, digestive microbiome. Hashukayaks diversify their diet as opportunities allow, digging up roots, breaking into insect colonies to snatch up larvae, or even consuming the occasional carrion. Only in three documented cases have the creatures actively chased down larger fauna to consume, and each incident seemed to be aberrant behavior associated with nutritional deficiencies or high stress.<br/><br/> Adult male and female hashukayaks live different lifestyles and inhabit different territories that overlap only periodically. When most amateur xenobiologists think of hashukayaks, they imagine the female adult, bald but for a narrow band of long hairs around the neck. These sensitive whiskers allow female hashukayaks to sense an array of stimuli, and their leaner bodies allow them to cover large distances to find food or escape predators. Female hashukayaks gather in large herds for protection, traveling with their young. As the long summer ends, these herds migrate from the higher-gravity equator toward the rim, where the planet\u2019s divergent tectonic plates form warm lakes and fertile grasslands.<br/><br/> There, the males live year round in the low-gravity plains. Male hashukayaks grow bulkier in this environment, but for all the competitive advantages their mass provides, they have a limited range. In an area with normal gravity, a male moves at half speed and gradually becomes sick and dies as its weight compresses its digestive tract. The front third of a male\u2019s body is covered in dense hair, with the greatest concentration around its neck and hump. This shields the animal from the broad horns that males grow and use to battle one another for dominance during the long summers. For all their brutal competition, male hashukayaks become much more docile during the transitional season, when the migratory females and juveniles travel to the rim. At that time, dominant males use their feeding tentacles to build elaborate altars or bowers made of logs, dried grasses, and smoothed pebbles. The fancier the installation and its contents, the more attractive the male, and accomplished architects can mate numerous times in a season."}, "Hobgoblin Lieutenant": {"title": "Hobgoblin Lieutenant", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive 2 pg. 76", "cr": "7", "xp": "3200", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "LE", "creature_type": "humanoid", "creature_subtype": "goblinoid", "initiative": "+5", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+14", "aura": null, "hp": "105", "rp": null, "eac": "19", "kac": "21, +1 vs. combat maneuvers", "fort_save": "+9", "ref_save": "+7", "will_save": "+8", "defensive_abilities": "battle hardened", "immunities": null, "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "30 ft.

Most commonly, herd animals are herbivores or docile omnivores. \r\n\r\n better represent fiercer animals, including aggressive herbivores and omnivores that may or may not move in groups of their own kind.\r\n\r\n In the Pact Worlds, the most common herd animals are domesticated. When various species took to exploring and colonizing the stars, they brought their livestock with them. For instance, cattle, goats, and sheep can be found on Absalom Station, as well as on any world where humans have a significant presence. Herd animals in the Pact Worlds serve a variety of purposes in the various societies that cultivate and support them. Farmers and engineers commonly maintain groups of herd animals to harvest their meat, though keeping herd animals for their shorn fur to create textiles is a more sustainable practice. Other cultivators leverage herd animals as mounts or pack animals, and training these docile creatures can result in large profits for professionals who are particularly skilled in this pursuit.\r\n\r\n More rarely, some xenobiologists even cultivate groups of herd animals for scientists and corporations who wish to stabilize wild planets\u2019 ecosystems. In this case, interested parties might place large numbers of pack animals in foreign locales to help tame rampant vegetation growth or provide prey for a dying species of predator. The goal of such projects is almost always to improve a planet\u2019s suitability for colonization, mining, or farming. However, this practice is often controversial among ethnobiologists, who argue that introducing large populations of non-native species in this manner produces harmful and unforeseen results more often than it aids environments. \r\n\r\n The herd animals in this entry serve a couple of purposes.

Its shaggy fur is home to a plethora of algae and moss species, giving the ruthig a mottled green color useful as camouflage in the herbivore\u2019s native woodlands. Wild ruthigs travel in grazing herds, which are less camouflaged during the birthing season when gray-furred young are born. People of Castrovel domesticate the beasts for their honey-sweet milk and succulent meat.\r\n\r\n A ruthig is a Medium herd animal that is about 4 feet tall at the withers and 6 feet tall with its head raised high.

Other predators, deprived of such contact, often see sentient explorers as an unfamiliar form of potential sustenance, making confrontations inevitable.\r\n\r\n Predators come in all shapes and sizes, limited only by the environment where they are found.

A wide maw filled with two rows of fangs dominates the creature\u2019s head, and eight beady eyes run in two vertical rows along the bridge of its nose. A wide, flat crest tops its skull, behind which writhe a mass of short, smooth tentacles. A smaller bundle of tentacles tips the nyssholora\u2019s tail. These tentacles serve two purposes. First, the nyssholora uses them to collect energy from the atmosphere. Second, they aid the nyssholora in sensing the presence of telepathic prey, including formians and lashuntas. Stealth in the plains is all but impossible for a creature the size of a nyssholora, and it makes little effort to camouflage itself, sporting bright neon striations of yellow and orange across its thick purple or pink hide.\r\n\r\n Nyssholoras nest and lay eggs, and both parents keep watch over unhatched young in the treacherous Castrovelian wilderness. Brooding nyssholoras are particularly aggressive, due to hunger and the desire to protect their offspring. When young nyssholoras hatch, they remain in the nest for only a day. They then stay near a parent, learning how to hunt. Juvenile nyssholoras become more and more independent over the course of a month and then set out on their own or in small groups that typically end up breaking up a couple months later. Adult nyssholoras have been known to respond to distress calls of their own offspring up to a year after separation.\r\n\r\n The people of Castrovel hunt nyssholoras to keep their numbers down. Big-game hunters collect the beasts\u2019 phasic claws, the third segment of the creature\u2019s forearms. These bladed talons are sharp, but their real danger is that they vibrate at ultrasonic speeds, creating a blade of concentrated sound waves that precedes the physical structure of the claw as it swipes through the air. This can cut through even extremely dense materials. Because of these adaptations, Castrovelian scientists have long believed that nyssholoras evolved to hunt prey that had both telepathy and preternaturally strong armor. This hypothetical prey has long since vanished from Castrovel, but the nyssholora, lacking predators to challenge its position at the top of the food chain, has remained. More than one nyssholora has used its talons to carve open vehicle hulls or cut into city walls to get at prey.\r\n\r\n Similarly, the volume and force with which a nyssholora releases its low, resonant roar are enough to weaken the structural integrity of buildings and concuss the bodies of other creatures. This mighty bellow offers potential prey an early warning to the beast\u2019s approach since, in the absence of overwhelming ambient noise, a nyssholora\u2019s cry can be heard as far as 20 miles away. The beast\u2019s roar is so iconic that an entire genre of loud, growling music popular among korasha lashuntas adopted its name\u2014originally as an insult from the style\u2019s detractors, but quickly embraced by fans. Nyssholoran roar performances can be heard in counterculture hot spots throughout the Pact Worlds.\r\n\r\n In its horizontal walking pose, an adult nyssholora is 15 feet tall at the hip but can stand upright to over 20 feet. The typical adult nyssholora stretches as much as 40 feet from the tip of its tail to its nose and weighs 15 tons, although formian and lashunta legends tell of epic specimens two or three times recorded sizes. Juvenile nyssholoras are less than half the size and weigh almost 2 tons."}, "Juvenile Solar Wisp": {"title": "Juvenile Solar Wisp", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive 2 pg. 116", "cr": "5", "xp": "1600", "size": "Huge", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "outsider", "creature_subtype": "air", "initiative": "+5", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+11", "aura": "", "hp": "63", "rp": "", "eac": "17", "kac": "19", "fort_save": "+9", "ref_save": "+7", "will_save": "+4", "defensive_abilities": "void adaptation", "immunities": "elemental immunities, fire, radiation", "resistances": "", "weaknesses": "vulnerable to cold", "spell_resistance": "", "damage_reduction": "", "speed": "fly 30 ft.

Most commonly, herd animals are herbivores or docile omnivores. \r\n\r\n better represent fiercer animals, including aggressive herbivores and omnivores that may or may not move in groups of their own kind.\r\n\r\n In the Pact Worlds, the most common herd animals are domesticated. When various species took to exploring and colonizing the stars, they brought their livestock with them. For instance, cattle, goats, and sheep can be found on Absalom Station, as well as on any world where humans have a significant presence. Herd animals in the Pact Worlds serve a variety of purposes in the various societies that cultivate and support them. Farmers and engineers commonly maintain groups of herd animals to harvest their meat, though keeping herd animals for their shorn fur to create textiles is a more sustainable practice. Other cultivators leverage herd animals as mounts or pack animals, and training these docile creatures can result in large profits for professionals who are particularly skilled in this pursuit.\r\n\r\n More rarely, some xenobiologists even cultivate groups of herd animals for scientists and corporations who wish to stabilize wild planets\u2019 ecosystems. In this case, interested parties might place large numbers of pack animals in foreign locales to help tame rampant vegetation growth or provide prey for a dying species of predator. The goal of such projects is almost always to improve a planet\u2019s suitability for colonization, mining, or farming. However, this practice is often controversial among ethnobiologists, who argue that introducing large populations of non-native species in this manner produces harmful and unforeseen results more often than it aids environments. \r\n\r\n The herd animals in this entry serve a couple of purposes.

Wild ruthigs travel in grazing herds, which are less camouflaged during the birthing season when gray-furred young are born. People of Castrovel domesticate the beasts for their honey-sweet milk and succulent meat.\r\n\r\n A ruthig is a Medium herd animal that is about 4 feet tall at the withers and 6 feet tall with its head raised high.

Herding behavior allows animals to gather and move together for protection from predators. Most commonly, herd animals are herbivores or docile omnivores. \r\n\r\n better represent fiercer animals, including aggressive herbivores and omnivores that may or may not move in groups of their own kind.\r\n\r\n In the Pact Worlds, the most common herd animals are domesticated. When various species took to exploring and colonizing the stars, they brought their livestock with them. For instance, cattle, goats, and sheep can be found on Absalom Station, as well as on any world where humans have a significant presence. Herd animals in the Pact Worlds serve a variety of purposes in the various societies that cultivate and support them. Farmers and engineers commonly maintain groups of herd animals to harvest their meat, though keeping herd animals for their shorn fur to create textiles is a more sustainable practice. Other cultivators leverage herd animals as mounts or pack animals, and training these docile creatures can result in large profits for professionals who are particularly skilled in this pursuit.\r\n\r\n More rarely, some xenobiologists even cultivate groups of herd animals for scientists and corporations who wish to stabilize wild planets\u2019 ecosystems. In this case, interested parties might place large numbers of pack animals in foreign locales to help tame rampant vegetation growth or provide prey for a dying species of predator. The goal of such projects is almost always to improve a planet\u2019s suitability for colonization, mining, or farming. However, this practice is often controversial among ethnobiologists, who argue that introducing large populations of non-native species in this manner produces harmful and unforeseen results more often than it aids environments. \r\n\r\n The herd animals in this entry serve a couple of purposes. Employ them as written when you need statistics for this sort of creature. To create a unique herd animal, use the stat blocks here and your concept as starting points. Decide what type of natural weapon the animal has, from antlers to hooves, altering the damage type to suit the weapon. Then add elements from Appendix 2: Environmental Grafts (see page 138). Tailor anything you want to fit your concept. \r\n\r\n The ruthig is a mammal with six legs, padded feet with toenails, a long and thin neck, an extended jaw with flat teeth, a lengthy and rough tongue, and two pairs of eyes. Its shaggy fur is home to a plethora of algae and moss species, giving the ruthig a mottled green color useful as camouflage in the herbivore\u2019s native woodlands. Wild ruthigs travel in grazing herds, which are less camouflaged during the birthing season when gray-furred young are born. People of Castrovel domesticate the beasts for their honey-sweet milk and succulent meat.\r\n\r\n A ruthig is a Medium herd animal that is about 4 feet tall at the withers and 6 feet tall with its head raised high. On average, a ruthig weighs about 250 pounds.

What unites these disparate species is that their diets include the meat of other creatures and that they hunt and kill to acquire this food. On planets where sapient species are dominant, predators have learned that weapon-wielding creatures can be deadly prey. Other predators, deprived of such contact, often see sentient explorers as an unfamiliar form of potential sustenance, making confrontations inevitable.\r\n\r\n Predators come in all shapes and sizes, limited only by the environment where they are found. Bigger predators rely on abundant food, cycles of inactivity, an omnivorous diet, or a combination of these. Smaller predators have fewer requirements and can be equally dangerous; even very small animals can evolve pack tactics to overwhelm larger and stronger creatures.

During these times, human-sized and smaller offworlders are invited to try their hands at moonflower hunts.\r\n\r\n Xenobotanists have long been intrigued by the moonflower\u2019s ability to produce powerful bursts of light. After many unsuccessful attempts to harness this capability from moonflower tissue alone, they discovered that grafting a bioengineered light-producing nodule to another living creature could give that host the ability to activate a similar light-burst effect.

Their home planet\u2019s relatively low gravity and fast predatory species resulted in the pahtras evolving into a lean race with elongated humanoid bodies and limbs. Pahtras\u2019 fur ranges in color from tawny brown to shades of black and gray, while their eyes can be virtually any color of the visible spectrum. According to ancient traditions, a pahtra\u2019s unique facial pattern indicates her character and potential for achievement. Some pahtra societies still assign adolescent pahtras to a specific social role after a reading of her face patterns by a pahtra mystic. However, the most recent generations of pahtras have begun to resist this often-superficial classification, especially as news reaches Vesk-6 of prominent offworld pahtras who break their supposed type.\r\n\r\n While the tradition of assigning status based on facial fur patterns is fading, similarly ancient rites requiring all pahtras, regardless of status, to participate in a dangerous, weeks-long competition in their 15th year are still very common. Such competitions involve dividing the adolescents into groups of a dozen each and sending them into the jungle. There, they face both natural threats and their peers in survival challenges and war games that result in more than a few casualties each year. The performance of a pahtra in this rite often dictates the trajectory of their social standing thereafter.\r\n\r\n Most pahtras are asexual, and a relatively small number of breeding couples bolster the population with litters of six to eight kits at a time. While pahtras frequently form lifelong, loving relationships with a single partner or small set of partners, they cherish individualism above all else. From their first steps, they strive to distinguish themselves from their siblings by developing and perfecting a unique ability. This inclination also makes pahtras highly suspicious of conformism\u2014including that demanded by their vesk overseers\u2014and while they can be deeply distrustful of strangers, they are also very protective of those they consider friends.\r\n\r\n Pahtra culture sees music and battle as the two greatest possible career paths, defining all other activities by how they relate to these callings. They also see strong synergies in the two pursuits, using music not just for artistic expression but also to coordinate battles and intimidate their enemies. Pahtras have perfect pitch and are natural musicians, and their music plays a central role in their society. They use arias, ballads, and elaborate musicals to tell the stories of their most legendary warriors, and they play bass- and percussion-heavy music to bolster their morale on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n When the first wave of vesk forces arrived on Vesk-6, pahtras were much less advanced technologically, and though their many nations had significant similarities in culture, they were in no way united or uniform. They were ultimately unable to resist the vesk\u2019s advanced weapons, starships, and interplanetary empire, but their warrior traditions, knowledge of local terrain, and willingness to fight for their homelands ensured the vesk conquest was neither swift nor easy. Their bold resistance won the pahtras no small amount of respect from the lizard-like race. While some smaller pahtra collectives were destroyed in the war, others formed coalitions and grew into larger and more varied nation-states. In time, all these major pahtra nations signed treaties with the Veskarium, accepting vesk rule and a host of Veskarium regulations in return for largely maintaining self-rule in local matters.

Their home planet\u2019s relatively low gravity and fast predatory species resulted in the pahtras evolving into a lean race with elongated humanoid bodies and limbs. Pahtras\u2019 fur ranges in color from tawny brown to shades of black and gray, while their eyes can be virtually any color of the visible spectrum. According to ancient traditions, a pahtra\u2019s unique facial pattern indicates her character and potential for achievement. Some pahtra societies still assign adolescent pahtras to a specific social role after a reading of her face patterns by a pahtra mystic. However, the most recent generations of pahtras have begun to resist this often-superficial classification, especially as news reaches Vesk-6 of prominent offworld pahtras who break their supposed type.\r\n\r\n While the tradition of assigning status based on facial fur patterns is fading, similarly ancient rites requiring all pahtras, regardless of status, to participate in a dangerous, weeks-long competition in their 15th year are still very common. Such competitions involve dividing the adolescents into groups of a dozen each and sending them into the jungle. There, they face both natural threats and their peers in survival challenges and war games that result in more than a few casualties each year. The performance of a pahtra in this rite often dictates the trajectory of their social standing thereafter.\r\n\r\n Most pahtras are asexual, and a relatively small number of breeding couples bolster the population with litters of six to eight kits at a time. While pahtras frequently form lifelong, loving relationships with a single partner or small set of partners, they cherish individualism above all else. From their first steps, they strive to distinguish themselves from their siblings by developing and perfecting a unique ability. This inclination also makes pahtras highly suspicious of conformism\u2014including that demanded by their vesk overseers\u2014and while they can be deeply distrustful of strangers, they are also very protective of those they consider friends.\r\n\r\n Pahtra culture sees music and battle as the two greatest possible career paths, defining all other activities by how they relate to these callings. They also see strong synergies in the two pursuits, using music not just for artistic expression but also to coordinate battles and intimidate their enemies. Pahtras have perfect pitch and are natural musicians, and their music plays a central role in their society. They use arias, ballads, and elaborate musicals to tell the stories of their most legendary warriors, and they play bass- and percussion-heavy music to bolster their morale on the battlefield.\r\n\r\n When the first wave of vesk forces arrived on Vesk-6, pahtras were much less advanced technologically, and though their many nations had significant similarities in culture, they were in no way united or uniform. They were ultimately unable to resist the vesk\u2019s advanced weapons, starships, and interplanetary empire, but their warrior traditions, knowledge of local terrain, and willingness to fight for their homelands ensured the vesk conquest was neither swift nor easy. Their bold resistance won the pahtras no small amount of respect from the lizard-like race. While some smaller pahtra collectives were destroyed in the war, others formed coalitions and grew into larger and more varied nation-states. In time, all these major pahtra nations signed treaties with the Veskarium, accepting vesk rule and a host of Veskarium regulations in return for largely maintaining self-rule in local matters. Only the enormous Command 6 military base that serves as the capital of Vesk-6 and base of operations for the planet\u2019s vesk high despot is ruled entirely by vesk officers and officials; more remote regions are generally overseen by a consul who works with local pahtra governments.

Usually taking a roughly spherical form, a plasma ooze pulses with a brilliant array of pink, purple, and blue light, connected in a complex network that reaches whitehot intensity at its many nodes. These oozes are most often seen in the immediate vicinity of a star\u2019s surface, but explorers have occasionally sighted the mysterious beings hovering near powerful electromagnetic phenomena in numerous system, both in the vacuum of space and on the surfaces of volatile planetoids. A typical plasma ooze is a rough hemisphere approximately 20 feet in diameter, weighing close to 100 tons.<br/><br/> The origin of these oozes has been hotly debated since before the Gap, with ancient scholars speculating that the creatures originated on the Plane of Fire and were drawn to an inhabited system\u2019s sun. However, nearly a century ago, the discovery of deserted cities within the sun of the Pact Worlds\u2014along with modern claims by Plane of Fire natives that yet more civilizations exist in deeper layers of the sun\u2014spawned a host of new theories, as abundant as the oozes are rare.<br/><br/> One of the most popular hypotheses is that the sun\u2019s abandoned cities, now called the Burning Archipelago, were the site of an ancient civilization\u2019s attempts to harness the power of the star. As proponents of this story would have it, the experimenters were successful in creating the first plasma oozes, but they soon lost control of their creations and were quickly eradicated by the beings. Supposedly, the unleashed plasma oozes not only shut down the technological defenses of their creators, but also wiped out the digitally stored collective knowledge upon which the civilization relied for its continued survival. This version of events, though based almost entirely on conjecture and unable to explain plasma oozes\u2019 presence in other systems, is nonetheless often cited by those who caution against an overdependence on technology.<br/><br/> Such theories are met with vehement opposition by Sarenites, many of whom believe the Dawnflower herself created the sun\u2019s cities and would not have permitted such a fate to befall them. Some of Sarenrae\u2019s worshipers believe that the goddess created the plasma oozes too, making them custodians of the Archipelago and solar sites in other systems, and that whatever emptied the sun\u2019s cities did so despite the oozes\u2019 protection.<br/><br/> Plasma ooze sightings often occur at the perimeter of a star just before massive flares occur, leading many to believe that the two are connected somehow. Some of Sarenrae\u2019s worshipers claim that the oozes themselves draw out such flares in a search for some artifact buried deep with the sun, while more recent evidence points to the flares being involved in their reproduction.<br/><br/> Several centuries ago, shortly after Drift travel became widespread, a small residential starship on a routine trip through the Drift reported encountering an enormous plasma ooze, many times larger than those of the Pact Worlds\u2019 sun. Since then, a sighting is made every few decades on average, with the ooze\u2019s reported size gradually increasing each time. How the plasma ooze entered the Drift in the first place is an open question; while most agree that the ooze must have been ripped from the Material Plane by the activation of a Drift engine, some suspect a deeper connection between the ooze and the Drift, normally accessible only by technology granted by the ascended AI god Triune. A few scholars even posit that the creature\u2019s distortion of electromagnetic fields somehow granted it access to the Drift. Plasma oozes\u2019 strong electromagnetic field makes them extremely dangerous to encounter in the vacuum of space, since even shielded starships can find themselves adrift after crossing paths with one. Similarly, in the rare instances when a plasma ooze takes up residence on a populated planet\u2019s surface, the edges of its territory are often marked by the dusty hulls of disabled vehicles, their former owners having wisely abandoned them to live another day. Few living creatures survive contact with a plasma ooze, but those that do often bear terrible wounds that serve as permanent reminders of such oozes\u2019 fearsome power.<br/><br/> A small group of planar scions whose ancestry connects them to the Plane of Fire, and who have served in various military forces, has recently claimed to be actively hunting plasma oozes under the moniker \u201cthe Sunkillers.\u201d They have stockpiled electricity-resistant armor and defensive gear to complement their natural tolerance for fire, and they are currently amassing powerful sonic weaponry that they are confident will bypass the creatures\u2019 formidable defenses.

Although shantaks appear ungainly on land when perched on their two legs, their vast, bat-like wings enable the creatures to soar gracefully through vacuum as easily as they fly in atmospheres. Slimy scales cover a shantak\u2019s body, and its vaguely horselike head features a wide maw filled with dagger-like teeth. A shantak is about 30 feet long from nose to tail and weighs approximately 6,000 pounds. Planetside, shantaks inhabit remote and foreboding mountain peaks, but their ability to survive in and fly through vacuum means they can also be found in the void of space.<br/><br/> Despite their bestial appearances, shantaks are intelligent, and speak in shrill voices that sound like glass grinding against stone. They are willful creatures and cannot simply be trained as mounts. A would-be shantak rider must first seek out a shantak, braving its lair or hunting grounds, and then use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak\u2019s cooperation as a mount, often with a liberal dose of flattery. Even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas, or worse, revoke their shared defenses while in the depths of space so their riders asphyxiate and swiftly perish. The flesh of such unfortunate riders is particularly delightful to a shantak, especially if it is able to feed where the rider\u2019s one-time allies and friends can watch.<br/><br/> Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain humanoid winged creatures, such as faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain dreams, or specific types of winged humanoids more common in civilized regions. While these irrational fears are usually not so overwhelming as to have physical or mental effects on a shantak, shantaks do take pains to avoid confrontations with these other types of creatures if at all possible.<br/><br/> Shantaks\u2019 ability to travel the gulf of space ensures that these scaly creatures can be found on numerous worlds and their satellites. Yet despite this ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds on their own unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the depths of space. Before the widespread use of Drift technology, some species employed shantaks as a rare and dangerous method of traveling among the stars, and there may well be as-yet-undiscovered civilizations in the Vast that continue to do so\u2014perhaps because their technological advancement has not reached a level where they can use Drift travel.<br/><br/> Curiously, even those who have never encountered a shantak in real life often know of these creatures, for shantaks dwell in the shared dreams of slumbering minds as surely as in the depths of space. Some scientists and philosophers have gone so as far as to suggest that shantaks first hailed from a mysterious shared demiplane within the Dimension of Dreams called the Dreamlands. These scholars further posit that eerie and dangerous rituals have enabled the creatures to transform themselves from figments imagined by sleeping minds into creatures that exist in the waking world on countless planets.<br/><br/> Although shantaks do not enjoy the presence of active starships\u2014almost as if the energies exuded by an active power core cause them some sort of intense discomfort\u2014 shantaks are quite fond of derelict ships. Large numbers of shantaks have been reported to roost in the nooks and crannies of a drifting hulk\u2019s hull, and exploration of the interior of these abandoned ships often reveals truly disturbing \u201ccaches\u201d of food\u2014the partially eaten remains of entire crews. Shantaks that roost in derelict starships take full advantage of their adoptive homes, ensuring their nests are well hidden from observation. These shantaks can be quite cunning in dressing the hulk in what appears to be valuable scrap, and some have even learned to tamper with shipboard alarm systems to send out false distress signals.

This tradition has lasted so long in part because of the kinship the lashuntas feel with their bonded shotalashus, but also because the symbiotic bond between the two species is deeply ingrained into lashunta culture. Shotalashu-mounted cavalry still serve as ceremonial honor guards for lashunta dignitaries, and members of all social stations regard their bonded mounts as occupying a cherished place in the family. Though shotalashus are seen less often in teeming metropolises than they are in smaller settlements, no city on Castrovel is devoid of at least basic amenities for the honored beasts, from training facilities to boarding services.\r\n\r\n While it\u2019s common for a lashunta to switch between shotalashus throughout her life, some bonds between beast and rider deepen over time, and it is not unheard of for a warrior to bond with a single shotalashu mount until death. Lashunta whose mounts die suffer psychic trauma and often require time to recover before they can bond with another mount, and shotalashus who lose their bonded riders have been known to grieve for months, or even years.\r\n\r\n Though rare, some shotalashus still live in the wild, forming feral packs that use their telepathy to bond not with a rider, but with one another, forming a highly effective collective mind that makes them efficient and deadly hunters. Particularly adventurous lashuntas set out on solo quests into the most remote of Castrovel\u2019s wilds in search of a potentially stronger mount from among untamed stock. These brave souls must first break an individual shotalashu away from its pack before attempting the long and arduous task of taming and eventually bonding with the creature.\r\n\r\n A typical domesticated shotalashu is over 10 feet long from snout to tail-tip, and weighs more than 1,000 pounds, while wild specimens can grow as large as 12 feet in length and weigh a staggering 1,500 pounds.\r\n\r\n As technology has advanced, telepathic bonding with shotalashus has become possible for those who aren\u2019t lashunta.

When various species took to exploring and colonizing the stars, they brought their livestock with them. For instance, cattle, goats, and sheep can be found on Absalom Station, as well as on any world where humans have a significant presence. Herd animals in the Pact Worlds serve a variety of purposes in the various societies that cultivate and support them. Farmers and engineers commonly maintain groups of herd animals to harvest their meat, though keeping herd animals for their shorn fur to create textiles is a more sustainable practice. Other cultivators leverage herd animals as mounts or pack animals, and training these docile creatures can result in large profits for professionals who are particularly skilled in this pursuit.\r\n\r\n More rarely, some xenobiologists even cultivate groups of herd animals for scientists and corporations who wish to stabilize wild planets\u2019 ecosystems. In this case, interested parties might place large numbers of pack animals in foreign locales to help tame rampant vegetation growth or provide prey for a dying species of predator. The goal of such projects is almost always to improve a planet\u2019s suitability for colonization, mining, or farming. However, this practice is often controversial among ethnobiologists, who argue that introducing large populations of non-native species in this manner produces harmful and unforeseen results more often than it aids environments. \r\n\r\n The herd animals in this entry serve a couple of purposes.

Wild ruthigs travel in grazing herds, which are less camouflaged during the birthing season when gray-furred young are born. People of Castrovel domesticate the beasts for their honey-sweet milk and succulent meat.\r\n\r\n A ruthig is a Medium herd animal that is about 4 feet tall at the withers and 6 feet tall with its head raised high.

Other predators, deprived of such contact, often see sentient explorers as an unfamiliar form of potential sustenance, making confrontations inevitable.\r\n\r\n Predators come in all shapes and sizes, limited only by the environment where they are found.

Squoxes are furry, vulpine animals roughly 2 feet in length and weighing around 15 pounds. They are quadrupedal, with five-fingered prehensile paws that have rotating wrists and ankles, allowing them to climb down surfaces headfirst like a squirrel. The creature\u2019s other features are fox-like, including a flattened head with triangular ears, a pointed snout, and a bushy tail. Squox fur can come in hues of red orange, gray, fulvous, white, or brown, with white on the belly, neck, and tail tip. The species also has an array of fur patterns and environmental adaptations, such as long ears that allow desert-dwelling squoxes to disperse heat and thick seasonal fur and coloration for those accustomed to arctic regions.\r\n\r\n Squoxes are among the most intelligent animal species in the Pact Worlds, exhibiting social behaviors and hierarchies along with a vast vocal repertoire. When confronted, squoxes are devious tacticians, especially in groups. They are clever enough to poke eyes, bite sensitive regions, and steal objects to bait enemies away from a den.\r\n\r\n Although they originated on Castrovel, squoxes gained popularity across the Pact Worlds for their adorable features and ability to adapt to new environments. The people of Asana happily exported squoxes, which lashuntas see as pests. Over centuries, squoxes spread and successfully adjusted to biomes across the Pact Worlds. They\u2019ve even begun to appear in the wild in the Veskarium and worlds in the Vast.\r\n\r\n Xenowardens have tried to preserve the native squoxes of Castrovel while simultaneously curbing the incursion of the species into other ecologies. The group fears the invasive critters might irrevocably damage invaded ecosystems if left unchecked. Therefore, Xenowardens actively promote squox hunting on numerous worlds, as well as legal controls against importing the animals and releasing them into the wild. \r\n\r\n Squoxes are abundant across the Pact Worlds, breeding quickly and living for up to 10 years, or double that in captivity. Their intelligence and delightful appearance make them desirable companion animals, and they\u2019re intelligent enough to be easily trained. Squoxes are also loyal, protective, charming, and entertaining, making them great companions for children. As clever and fun as they are, squoxes are also notorious for mischief, such as figuring out how to open cabinets and work simple machinery with the same aptitude as a very young sapient. They\u2019ve even been known to clean up after themselves to hide thefts or accidents from their owners. Nevertheless, squoxes make great pets.\r\n\r\n A squox kit can be purchased for 100 credits at 1 month old, just weaned from its mother. Untrained squoxes born as pets are usually domesticated and friendly but likely to misbehave without training. However, unscrupulous dealers gather squox kits in the wild and pass them off as domesticated, selling them at bargain prices. Squoxes reach adulthood by 10 months, and a fully trained adult squox goes for 400 credits.\r\n\r\n A squox kit can be reared, or an older squox domesticated and trained, using the Survival skill, which takes 3 months.

The Swarm moves from planet to planet in tremendous organic hive-ships, reducing each so-called \u201cfeeder world\u201d to a barren husk incapable of supporting life, and occasionally altering its own DNA in the process to take on qualities from that world\u2019s species. Once it has consumed everything of use on a planet, the Swarm moves on, not bothering to hold territory.\r\n\r\n Ironically, one of the most violent races in the galaxy also birthed one of the most peaceful, as a mutation within a sub-hive gave life to the shirrens, who broke away to form a new species. The Swarm is notorious not just because of the invasion that finally ended hostilities between the Pact Worlds and the Veskarium, but also thanks to the warnings of shirrens, who understand the Swarm\u2019s might and its hunger as no other race can.\r\n\r\n While individual components of the Swarm have some form of intelligence\u2014or at least a set of complex programmed behaviors that resembles intellect\u2014they cannot generally be reasoned with in any fashion. Swarm components rarely communicate with other creatures, as they see every alien entity as either a food source or a threat. The Swarm\u2019s morale is unbreakable, and while individual components might retreat for tactical reasons, fear is utterly unknown to the Swarm and its components.\r\n\r\n The Swarm rarely wields manufactured weapons, instead integrating biotechnology grown or grafted onto component creatures. Because of its constant genetic upgrading and experimentation, the Swarm encompasses components with a wide variety of shapes, sizes, and capabilities, from the mighty dreadlancers to the microscopic, bloodstream-infesting toxicytes.

Aasimars and tieflings, the mortal offspring of celestials and fiends, respectively, are the most common of these. Though planar scions resemble their humanoid kin, their appearance and demeanor bear supernatural touches. Tieflings might have horns, vestigial wings, or cloven hooves, while aasimars may have glowing eyes or a metallic sheen to their hair and skin.\r\n\r\n Because of their innate curiosity, humans are more likely to dally with outsiders, and as a consequence, a significant percentage of planar scions living in the Pact Worlds are descended from humans. However, because humans are far less populous than in pre-Gap eras, planar scions descended from other humanoid races are now far more numerous. A planar scion might pass for a member of the humanoid parent\u2019s species, or the scion\u2019s otherworldly features could make their origin obvious to those who are familiar with the species\u2019 normal characteristics.

Squoxes are furry, vulpine animals roughly 2 feet in length and weighing around 15 pounds. They are quadrupedal, with five-fingered prehensile paws that have rotating wrists and ankles, allowing them to climb down surfaces headfirst like a squirrel. The creature\u2019s other features are fox-like, including a flattened head with triangular ears, a pointed snout, and a bushy tail. Squox fur can come in hues of red orange, gray, fulvous, white, or brown, with white on the belly, neck, and tail tip. The species also has an array of fur patterns and environmental adaptations, such as long ears that allow desert-dwelling squoxes to disperse heat and thick seasonal fur and coloration for those accustomed to arctic regions.\r\n\r\n Squoxes are among the most intelligent animal species in the Pact Worlds, exhibiting social behaviors and hierarchies along with a vast vocal repertoire. When confronted, squoxes are devious tacticians, especially in groups. They are clever enough to poke eyes, bite sensitive regions, and steal objects to bait enemies away from a den.\r\n\r\n Although they originated on Castrovel, squoxes gained popularity across the Pact Worlds for their adorable features and ability to adapt to new environments. The people of Asana happily exported squoxes, which lashuntas see as pests. Over centuries, squoxes spread and successfully adjusted to biomes across the Pact Worlds. They\u2019ve even begun to appear in the wild in the Veskarium and worlds in the Vast.\r\n\r\n Xenowardens have tried to preserve the native squoxes of Castrovel while simultaneously curbing the incursion of the species into other ecologies. The group fears the invasive critters might irrevocably damage invaded ecosystems if left unchecked. Therefore, Xenowardens actively promote squox hunting on numerous worlds, as well as legal controls against importing the animals and releasing them into the wild. \r\n\r\n Squoxes are abundant across the Pact Worlds, breeding quickly and living for up to 10 years, or double that in captivity. Their intelligence and delightful appearance make them desirable companion animals, and they\u2019re intelligent enough to be easily trained. Squoxes are also loyal, protective, charming, and entertaining, making them great companions for children. As clever and fun as they are, squoxes are also notorious for mischief, such as figuring out how to open cabinets and work simple machinery with the same aptitude as a very young sapient. They\u2019ve even been known to clean up after themselves to hide thefts or accidents from their owners. Nevertheless, squoxes make great pets.\r\n\r\n A squox kit can be purchased for 100 credits at 1 month old, just weaned from its mother. Untrained squoxes born as pets are usually domesticated and friendly but likely to misbehave without training. However, unscrupulous dealers gather squox kits in the wild and pass them off as domesticated, selling them at bargain prices. Squoxes reach adulthood by 10 months, and a fully trained adult squox goes for 400 credits.\r\n\r\n A squox kit can be reared, or an older squox domesticated and trained, using the Survival skill, which takes 3 months.

These outsiders are constantly cheerful, frequently playing pranks and making jokes, but their good humor belies a great deal of power. Tritidairs have a deep connection to the nuclear fusion that powers stars, giving them their star-related abilities. Their eyes twinkle with starlight that can fascinate some viewers, so they keep their eyes covered with stylish goggles to prevent accidental exposure. Travelers in starships occasionally spot the unmistakable purple streak of light as a tritidair flies past.\r\n\r\nTritidairs are devoted servants of Desna and frequently travel to Cynosure, the pole star and home of Desna\u2019s palace. Desnan priests say that the goddess planted a seed in a new star, which shot forth light that became the first tritidair. Although this origin story might be apocryphal, what is certain is that the birth of every new star creates a tritidair. They don\u2019t remain near their stars of origin for long, but each tritidair has a unique pattern of glowing dots on their butterfly wings corresponding to the locations of the stars where and when they were born.\r\n\r\nThese outsiders serve as messengers and pages for the Song of the Spheres, running errands for her throughout the galaxy. Although their starlight form enables interplanar travel, this method of travel has its limits. Tritidairs explain that not every star can provide passage\u2014some are broken\u2014but the concept is difficult to describe to others. Still, tritidairs can move quickly over vast distances to convey messages or provide aid to followers and allies of Desna who find themselves in trouble.\r\n\r\nTritidairs are fiercely loyal. The kindhearted and impulsive creatures don\u2019t seek out combat, nor does Desna commonly send them on missions involving violence. If pushed into combat, particularly if required to protect innocents, they are very willing to use spells and weapons to deal deadly damage. All tritidairs carry easily identifiable starknives patterned with constellations matching those on their wings. These magical starknives charge with energy each time the tritidair travels between stars. Many Desnans carry copies of these knives. Some who have interacted with a tritidair engrave such starknives with constellation patterns matching the wings of that tritidair as a way to honor and remember the azata, much like carving a dear friend\u2019s name on a personal treasure.\r\n\r\nThese azatas lack sexual characteristics, but some tritidairs choose a gender, and many favor the feminine, mimicking their goddess. They enjoy art, music, and theater, and it\u2019s not uncommon for a major performance to have a tritidair or two in attendance. When tritidairs meet in larger groups, they often enjoy playing games and sports. However, tritidairs don\u2019t have permanent residences or family units, and they don\u2019t stay in one place for long.\r\n\r\nTritidairs sometimes linger on Cynosure or in Elysium, but most prefer to remain on the Material Plane. They genuinely enjoy the company of mortals, and when not on assignments from Desna, tritidairs travel, alone or in small groups, to random planets or starships, where the azatas look for new friends and adventures. Because of this tritidair spirit of exploration, many species on various worlds have myths and stories of flying star children.\r\n\r\nAlthough tritidairs spread the worship of Desna, their primary motivations are to meet new creatures and have fun experiences. They aren\u2019t the most reliable when called upon by anyone but Desna, but nevertheless, some creatures and organizations successfully form alliances with tritidairs. Solarians and tritidairs can feel a connection to one another, given their mutual association with the stars.\r\n\r\nTritidairs don\u2019t age, and some have outlived the birth and death of stars. A tritidair can survive the destruction of its star of origin, and similarly the demise of a tritidair has no discernible effect on the star. Tritidairs also don\u2019t require sleep, but they engage in long meditations to dream. Not only do they find the experience amusing, but Desna can also speak with them through their dreams, sending the tritidairs their missions.\r\n\r\nOther creatures sleeping or engaging in similar deep rest near a meditating tritidair can find their dreams invaded by vivid visions from the azatas. Many who have such experiences report that their dreams never go back to normal, remaining rich and dramatic, but seldom troubling. Worshipers of Desna sometimes seek out tritidairs, hoping to earn this experience. \r\n\r\nSuch seekers also hope to have visions of Desna, such as those who have been blessed with tritidair-influenced dreams have claimed to receive. These assertions can be true\u2014Desna can use the neural pathways a tritidair\u2019s influence opens to communicate with other beings likely to aid the goddess\u2019s aims. Good-hearted dreamers find themselves becoming more spontaneous and venturesome, looking for opportunities to explore and help others. With this increase in boldness comes an increase in apparent luck, although what seems to be luck is just as likely to be an increased awareness of good opportunities and the\r\nwillingness to seize them."}, "Trox Defensor": {"title": "Trox Defensor", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive 2 pg. 126", "cr": "9", "xp": "6400", "size": "Large", "alignment": "LG", "creature_type": "monstrous", "creature_subtype": "humanoid", "initiative": "+4", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+17", "aura": null, "hp": "145", "rp": "4", "eac": "22", "kac": "24", "fort_save": "+13", "ref_save": "+12", "will_save": "+10", "defensive_abilities": "bulwark, guard\u2019s protection", "immunities": null, "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "50 ft., burrow 20 ft.", "melee": "advanced swoop hammer +22 (3d10+18 B; critical knockdown)", "ranged": "advanced arc emitter +19 (2d4+9 E) or stickybomb grenade III +19 (explode [20 ft., entangled 2d4 rounds, DC 16])", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "frenzy, grappler", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+6", "dex": "+0", "con": "+4", "int": "+1", "wis": "+3", "cha": "+1", "skills": "Athletics +22, Intimidate +17, Mysticism +17", "languages": "Common, Nchaki", "gear": "advanced iridishell, advanced swoop hammer, advanced arc emitter with 2 high-capacity batteries (40 charges each), stickybomb grenades III (2)", "other_abilities": "armor training, rapid recovery, vestigial arms", "environment": "any (Nchak)", "organization": "solitary, band (2\u20138), or clan (9\u201320)", "special_abilities": "<b>Bulwark (Ex)</b> When a trox fights defensively or takes the total defense action, he can grant half the bonus to AC granted by that action to an adjacent ally.<br/><br/> <b>Frenzy (Ex)</b> Once per day when a significant enemy causes an ally to take Hit Point damage, a trox can fly into a frenzy, gaining a +2 racial bonus to melee attack rolls and a \u20132 penalty to AC for 1 minute.<br/><br/> <b>Grappler (Ex)</b> Trox gain a +2 racial bonus to grapple combat maneuvers.<br/><br/> <b>Vesitigal Arms (Ex)</b> A trox\u2019s four vestigial arms can be used to hold, draw, or put away items of negligible bulk, but not to make attacks, wield weapons, or use items.", "description": "Trox are massive, sturdy creatures native to the Liavaran moon of Nchak.

Acrochors usually grow up to 8 to 12 feet in length and almost 1 foot in diameter. They are red and black in color with tough, knobby skin and a cluster of visual sensors that allow the creatures to see well even in dim light. Acrochors\u2019 mouths are on the undersides of their bodies, and they usually keep them closed except when attacking.<br/><br/> An acrochor often begins attacking its prey by lashing out with surprising speed to bite with jaws filled with razor-sharp teeth. Once its fangs are firmly implanted, the acrochor whips its tail to coil several times around the victim\u2019s body, using its powerful musculature to squeeze the life from the unfortunate prey. When its prey is dead, the acrochor leisurely tears into the flesh in a bloody and gruesome fashion. If an acrochor takes down a victim of its size or larger, the acrochor might need several days to devour the corpse, but it can digest both fresh and rotting meat without trouble.<br/><br/> After mating, an acrochor lays its fertilized eggs in a thermal vent or other warm place. Over the next day, the parent acrochor eats as much as it can, often consuming pieces of obsidian or other volcanic glass in the process. It then enters a state of hibernation in close proximity to its eggs, which incubate over the next few months. The acrochor\u2019s stomach acids slowly dissolve the volcanic glass as it sleeps, providing it with the minerals it needs to survive. Despite its dormant state, the acrochor has an almost supernatural connection to its eggs, waking the moment they hatch or if anything disturbs them.<br/><br/>"}, "Aeon Stone Network": {"title": "Aeon Stone Network", "flavor_text": "Starfinder #8: Escape from the Prison Moon pg. 55", "cr": "7", "xp": "3200", "size": "Fine", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "construct", "creature_subtype": "magical", "initiative": "+5", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision", "perception": "+14", "aura": null, "hp": "91", "rp": null, "eac": "19", "kac": "20", "fort_save": "+6", "ref_save": "+10", "will_save": "+6", "defensive_abilities": "swarm defenses", "immunities": "construct immunities, swarm immunities", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": "vulnerable to electricity", "spell_resistance": "18", "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "fly 40 ft.

Compared to older barathus, early stage barathus are more adventurous and individualistic, and their adaptation to the humanoid mindset makes it more difficult for them to merge completely with others of their kind. Most of these early stage barathus grow out of this phase, gaining the ability to fully integrate with others, yet recent generations have seen more and more barathus deliberately clinging to their juvenile mindsets.

However, the sharper claws on these extra appendages are mainly used for tearing through its prey\u2019s flesh to reach the bones. A crest-eater\u2019s vicious teeth are capable of delivering painful bites and injecting its devastating venom. Despite its rather reptilian appearance, the crest-eater shares many similarities to mammals, including a steady body temperature and the ability to bear live young.<br/><br/> Just as their biology skirts the edge of reptilian standards, so too does crest-eaters\u2019 behavior. They are exceptionally social and loving animals, forming small prides of unrelated adults to hunt prey, dig out mineral deposits, and guard one another while they sleep. Many bold young hunters have fallen after slaying a single crest-eater, only to find its halfdozen compatriots rising from the sand around them. Cresteaters give birth to one or two young after a long pregnancy, during which the female grows increasingly ravenous for flesh and water, and an entire pride may take to hunting and aggressively defending water sources to feed a single pregnant mother\u2019s needs. Newborn crest-eaters can dissolve bones immediately, though they are cautious predators until they begin to grow their first antler-shell around 1 year later.<br/><br/> Crest-eaters that grow up in close proximity to other creatures often form close bonds with them, and thus they can be found traveling with small crowds of scavengers that pick parasites off their protrusions and snatch up any kills the mighty hunters leave behind. Despite the creatures\u2019 social nature, especially large males become increasingly aggressive as they age and are often driven from their prides and the most reliable sources of food. Though a bit past their prime, these crest-eaters are still very dangerous, and they usually become unpredictable loners that attack desert communities without fear. It sometimes takes the collective effort of several heroes to either put down or drive off one of these wild beasts. Such an endeavor is rarely accomplished without casualties or major injuries.<br/><br/> Crest-eaters occupy a place of fear and reverence in distant kasathan history. The humanoids\u2019 ancient ancestors saw the beasts as terrifying messengers of death, particularly because of their tendency to rip off a victim\u2019s head and leave the remainder of the body unmolested. Today, the crest-eater is still feared but better understood, and kasathan scientists have extensively studied the unique crystals the beasts grow. These are now the foundation for kasathan solar technology. After millennia of kasathan contact with the wider galaxy, crest-eaters have spread to other worlds, both due to kasathan technology sometimes relying on the creatures\u2019 power-generating capabilities and as a result of other races employing crest-eaters as guard beasts, trophies to hunt, or exotic pets. The Idari even brought crest-eaters along on its long voyage, though these are kept carefully contained; rumors of escaped and feral crest-eaters living in the ship\u2019s ventilation shafts are assumed to be spurious.<br/><br/>"}, "Cybernetic Zombie": {"title": "Cybernetic Zombie", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 114", "cr": "3", "xp": "800", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "undead", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+4", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+8", "aura": null, "hp": "40", "rp": null, "eac": "14", "kac": "16", "fort_save": "+5", "ref_save": "+5", "will_save": "+4", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": "undead immunities", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": "vulnerable to electricity", "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "30 ft.", "melee": "slam +8 (1d6+5 B)", "ranged": "integrated static arc pistol +11 (1d6+3 E; critical arc 2)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "self-destruct (1d6+3 E, DC 12)", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+2", "dex": "+4", "con": "\u2014", "int": "\u2014", "wis": "+1", "cha": "+1", "skills": "Athletics +13", "languages": null, "gear": "static arc pistol with 2 batteries (20 charges each)", "other_abilities": "mindless, unliving", "environment": "any", "organization": "solitary, pair, phalanx (3\u201312), or army (13+)", "special_abilities": "<b>Integrated Weapons (Ex)</b> A cybernetic zombie\u2019s ranged weapon is integrated into its body and can\u2019t be disarmed.<br/><br/> <b>Self-Destruct (Ex)</b> A cybernetic zombie self-destructs when it is reduced to 0 HP, dealing an amount of electricity damage equal to 1d6 + the zombie\u2019s CR to all creatures in a 10-foot-radius burst.

As creatures with no motivations of their own, undead minions can also be found leaderless in the remains of ruined structures on planetary surfaces, adrift in derelict spacecraft, and even floating through the void of space. Whether encountered as servants of a mastermind who coordinates their movements or as a mindless threat in the wake of a cataclysmic disaster, undead minions are always a force to be reckoned with and a scourge to the living.\r\n\r\n Though there are countless types of mindless undead who serve as minions, the most common are cybernetic zombies, occult zombies, and skeletal undead. Both occult zombies and skeletal undead are animated by magical or supernatural forces and created either in dark necromantic rituals (including the \r\n\r\n spell) or by strange and mysterious reactions between the Material and Negative Energy Planes. Cybernetic zombies, on the other hand, arise as the result of technological implants that continue to function after their hosts have died, causing the body to act in a sad, shambling imitation of real life. Without control from an external force, these three kinds of undead simply go through the motions of their former lives, without reason, purpose, or the promise of an end to their miserable existences.\r\n\r\n In the Pact Worlds, most undead hail from the dead world of Eox and were created by the bone sages, though zombies and skeletal creatures are also found among the wreckage of ancient battlefields on Akiton and the enigmatic, alien structures on Aucturn. In contrast, cybernetic zombies are most often found on worlds with high levels of technological development, such as Aballon, Castrovel, and Verces.\r\n\r\n Those cultists of Urgathoa who see undeath as the pinnacle of being surround themselves with undead minions, both to use their abilities to terrorize innocent folk and to study their physiology in order to become undead themselves. While these worshipers would prefer to become more intelligent undead creatures, they often find that their fate is to rise up as a skeleton or zombie. Priests of Pharasma, on the other hand, often go out of their way to destroy all undead creatures, especially their mindless minions.\r\n\r\n Undead minions can be formed from the corpses of any type of creature, though most of those appearing in folklore from across the galaxy are animated versions of whatever culture is telling the tale. Humanoids tell of ambulatory corpses rising from their ritual burial grounds, while aberrations, dragons, and magical beasts have their own legends of mindless dead of their own species returning to plague the living. Whatever the undead creatures\u2019 original form, they often maintain natural attacks and other physical characteristics of their living counterparts even in undeath, though their mindless nature means they lose the ability to carry out complex tactics, conduct intricate or detailed tasks, and cast spells or take other mentally engaging actions. Yet the creatures\u2019 mindlessness makes them all the more frightening and threatening, as they can be neither reasoned with nor cowed.\r\n\r\n Use the following template grafts to create other versions of the undead minions presented here."}, "Deh-Nolo": {"title": "Deh-Nolo", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 32", "cr": "14", "xp": "38400", "size": "Large", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "aberration", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+4", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+30", "aura": null, "hp": "214", "rp": null, "eac": "27", "kac": "28", "fort_save": "+12", "ref_save": "+12", "will_save": "+19", "defensive_abilities": "open pustules", "immunities": "disease, mind-affecting effects, poison", "resistances": "cold 10, fire 10", "weaknesses": "brain dependency", "spell_resistance": "25", "damage_reduction": "10/magic", "speed": "20 ft., fly 40 ft.

This shared penchant strikes well-deserved fear into the hearts of all thinking creatures in the universe, and many spacefarers know it is best to avoid ships with Dominion markings altogether.<br/><br/> Deh-nolos are brilliant engineers and inventors among the Dominion of the Black, merging technology and biological systems in twisted and devious ways that are stunningly seamless. These creations are unlike cybernetics, in that they are often grown rather than built, and they blur the lines between living organs and complex machines. Using vulgar ingenuity and their surprisingly adroit singular \u201carms,\u201d deh-nolos designed and built the first Dominion starships, which are hybrid vessels with both organic and technological components. They also cultivated the first shipminds\u2014oozes that pilot these biomechanical starships. In addition to these marvels of engineering, deh-nolos are adept at repairing most technological devices, no matter what civilization built them. When presented with a device with which it is unfamiliar, a deh-nolo attempts to collect the brain of a member of the species that produced it in the hopes that doing so will provide the aberration with some flash of insight.<br/><br/> Mostly organic beings, deh-nolos secrete a metallic discharge that shimmers with disturbing beauty in natural sunlight. Deh-nolos can concentrate this liquid to form foul crystals that they either use as ranged projectiles or work into components for their mechanical devices. Such machine parts are malformed, resembling incomplete living organs and atrophied body parts, and many have common technological connectors and partially completed circuitry. Some reckless scientists have harvested these bits from deh-nolos and plugged them into their equipment or their own bodies, with varying and unpredictable outcomes. Most of the time, the result is horrendous\u2014and even deadly to the experimenter\u2014but the practice occasionally creates functional, albeit macabre, technology. Installed in sensors and other devices with video or audio output, these components cause the images on their screens to appear disturbingly fragmented or amplify and distort sound into mind-shattering cacophonies. Implanted in a living creature, these parts horrendously mutate the host body and often wrack it with unceasing pain.<br/><br/> Like many other creatures among the Dominion of the Black, deh-nolos fabricate and weaponize their own toxins. Poison-filled glands grow in patches across these creatures\u2019 bulky bodies, and anyone who ruptures one is exposed to the purulent fluid that sloshes within. Deh-nolos can also apply this toxic pus to the projectiles that they eject from their bodies, infecting those they strike.<br/><br/> Deh-nolos are not only extremely competent engineers, but also formidable spellcasters, weaving magic that, like their inventions, blurs the line between flesh and machine. With a thought, a deh-nolo can commandeer nearby technological devices, create a cloud of burning acid, or temporarily overwrite the DNA of a living creature to turn it into a twisted reflection of a robot. A deh-nolo uses its more offensive spells only in response to direct attacks, preferring to catch a single target unaware and render it helpless. From there, the aberration proceeds to carefully (and painfully, if the creature is still alive) extract its prey\u2019s brain and store it in one of its four brain pods. Deh-nolos with even one empty brain pod often go out of their way to procure a fresh replacement, almost as if they were addicted to the knowledge stored within the gray matter. A deh-nolo with no stored brains is jittery and desperate, lashing out at any non-Dominion creatures it can find, even those with animal intelligence. Once it is able to use its full complement of abilities, such a deh-nolo seeks out more sophisticated brains to replace the simpler ones, unless a more pressing matter is at hand.<br/><br/> Deh-nolos use their psychic potential, which is inherent in most Dominion of the Black creatures, to fly with incredible dexterity. The eerie sight of their alien forms gliding silently through the air with no obvious means of propulsion is usually enough to send most sane onlookers fleeing for their lives.<br/><br/>"}, "Draelik": {"title": "Draelik", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 36", "cr": "2", "xp": "600", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "NE", "creature_type": "humanoid", "creature_subtype": "draelik", "initiative": "+1", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+12", "aura": null, "hp": "21", "rp": null, "eac": "13", "kac": "14", "fort_save": "+3", "ref_save": "+1", "will_save": "+5, +2 vs. necromancy effects", "defensive_abilities": "dark matter", "immunities": null, "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": "is functions as the solarian stellar revelation of the same name.

As such, this loose organization houses all manner of fugitives, itinerants, and other scoundrels, and it is led by the inhabitants of Great Shadar, a waterless planet orbiting this system\u2019s dim star. These residents call themselves draeliks, and they are singularly united in support of the Confederacy\u2019s lawless ideals. To outsiders, however, they often seem more beholden to the grotesque sceaduinars: extraplanar creatures from the Negative Energy Plane, and the main figures of the most prominent draelik faith.<br/><br/> Draeliks are gaunt humanoids who average 7 feet in height. They have vestigial gills on their necks and slightly webbed hands and feet that hint that they may have once been an aquatic race, even though their home world currently has no oceans or lakes. Instead of hair, draeliks have short bristles on their heads. The color of draeliks\u2019 skin spans various shades of yellow, from mustard to saffron. Draeliks have three fingers and a thumb on each of their hands, and their limbs are slightly longer than those of humans.<br/><br/> The majority of draeliks have a mystical marking resembling a third eye that usually appears on the forehead. Known as Eyes of Enlightenment, these mark them as adherents of the philosophy of Ataxxea, a belief that pays homage to sceaduinars and finds entropy to be the most sublime force in the universe. Members of this faith don\u2019t actively set out to destroy, but they do very little to prevent and reverse natural deterioration. They build only items that speed up this decay, mostly by using negative energy. This pseudoreligion is widespread throughout the Confederacy, and many races native to the nebula count themselves as followers, receiving the Eye of Enlightenment during a ritualistic process involving special inks distilled from dark energies. Many who get this tattoo gain powers similar to solarians who focus on the graviton aspects of their cycle.<br/><br/> While some outsiders mistakenly conflate the nihilistic philosophy of Ataxxea with that of the Cult of the Devourer, most draeliks find the comparison deeply offensive. To them, their path is a stately and dignified march toward the inevitable and ordained end of all things, while the Devourer\u2019s followers cheapen the entire experience and ruin the work of generations by thrashing around in childlike tantrums, attempting to tear reality\u2019s fabric instead of embracing its beautiful unraveling.<br/><br/> The few draeliks who don\u2019t follow these entropic beliefs generally leave the Kurzach Nebula to seek their fortunes in the wider galaxy. Despite their rejection of their home world\u2019s nihilism, however, they are often still drawn to careers that emphasize the deeply ingrained talents of their people, hiring themselves out as deceptive assassins, furtive thieves, or mystics of dubious morality. Draeliks encased in shining armor and fighting for the betterment of every race and creed are rare, and those who seek to shatter the mold must always contend with their inner demons, sometimes even struggling against foul temptations from sceaduinars who want to bring them back into the fold."}, "Dragonkin": {"title": "Dragonkin", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 40", "cr": "9", "xp": "6400", "size": "Large", "alignment": "LN", "creature_type": "dragon", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+6", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision", "perception": "+17", "aura": null, "hp": "142", "rp": "4", "eac": "25", "kac": "27", "fort_save": "+14", "ref_save": "+12", "will_save": "+10", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": "fire, paralysis, sleep", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "40 ft., fly 120 ft.

Even before the advent of the Gap, dragonkin had a long history of alliance with humanoids, specifically in a region on Triaxus called the Skyfire Mandate, where many dragonkin carried ryphorian riders into battle against the armies of the evil dragons in the Drakelands. With the formation of the Pact, however, the Drakelands\u2019 masters ramped back their cruelty to ostensibly legal levels; these dragons eschewed their expansionist wars in favor of biased laws, secret police forces, and corporate oligarchies. In the wake of this peace and the dawn of easily accessible space travel, the Skyfire Mandate\u2019s famed Dragon Legion was renamed the Skyfire Legion and found a new purpose as a spacefaring mercenary league that protects innocent colony worlds that are beyond the reach of the Pact\u2019s laws. Yet not all dragonkin and their bonded partners signed up to join the legendary militia\u2019s new crusade, and some instead took to the stars independently to find their own fortunes.<br/><br/> Probably the greatest distinguishing feature of the dragonkin is their near-magical ability to bond with a non-dragonkin partner, traditionally a ryphorian. Living and working together\u2014 and often training to complement each other in combat\u2014a dragonkin and his partner can develop such a deep bond that they begin to literally read each other\u2019s thoughts, allowing them to act with perfect synchronization. On Triaxus, this historically resulted in bonded pairs known as dragonrider pairs: a humanoid partner riding into combat on the dragonkin\u2019s back and providing ranged and magical support. While there are still plenty of planet-dwelling pairs who practice this ancient form of combat, today, a dragonkin and his partner more often use their link to make an exceptional starship crew or ground assault squad. The bond between dragonkin and partner goes far beyond simple combat, however. While generally not romantically involved with each other, dragonkin and their partners act in sync in nearly every aspect of their lives and form an inseparable partnership that outside relationships must accommodate.<br/><br/> Life among the stars has led to variation within the dragonkin race, both culturally and genetically. While dragonkin adopted the use of armor, weapons, and other tools millennia ago, this reliance has accelerated dramatically in recent centuries. Dragonkin who remain on Triaxus and live according to tradition retain their abilities, yet those who make their homes in the cramped quarters of ships and space stations have a diminished ability to fly\u2014a fact that drives a wedge between traditionalists and the newer breed, the latter of which claim that a good starship provides the only wings they need.<br/><br/> Dragonkin tend to be intimidatingly stoic to strangers but loyal and fun with their friends. While the Skyfire Legion has an unusually heroic code of ethics for a mercenary unit, dragonkin in general are no more good or evil than humans, finding their own religious or moral codes or simply doing whatever it takes to protect their friends and families. While legionaries don\u2019t like to admit it, many dragonkin (and even their humanoid partners) are perfectly happy working for the chromatic-run corporations on Triaxus, conducting shady operations and making sure humanoids in the Drakelands remain properly cowed. Dragonkin have a particularly complicated relationship with the vesk, as the normally aggressive reptilian race have ancient religious scriptures claiming that the spirits of the Veskarium\u2019s greatest warriors would be reincarnated elsewhere in a form suspiciously similar to the dragonkin, and thus vesk have always treated dragonkin with respect and deference, even when their two systems were at war.<br/><br/> The average terrestrial dragonkin is 15 to 20 feet long and weighs roughly 2,000 pounds, while the spacefaring variety can be as small as half that size."}, "Drow Enforcer": {"title": "Drow Enforcer", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 42", "cr": "1", "xp": "400", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "humanoid", "creature_subtype": "elf", "initiative": "+4", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+10", "aura": null, "hp": "20", "rp": null, "eac": "16", "kac": "18", "fort_save": "+3", "ref_save": "+1", "will_save": "+3, +2 vs. enchantment", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": "sleep", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": "light blindness", "spell_resistance": "7", "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "25 ft.", "melee": "standard taclash +5 (1d4+2 S)", "ranged": "azimuth laser rifle +8 (1d8+1 F; critical burn 1d6) or shock grenade I +8 (explode [15 ft., 1d8 E, DC 10])", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "create darkness, fighting styles (arcane assailant), rune of the eldritch knight", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+1", "dex": "+4", "con": "+1", "int": "-1", "wis": "+0", "cha": "+1", "skills": "Acrobatics +10, Intimidate +5, Stealth +5", "languages": "Common, Drow", "gear": "lashunta ringwear I, azimuth laser rifle with 4 batteries (20 charges each), shock grenades I (2), standard taclash", "other_abilities": null, "environment": "any (Apostae)", "organization": "pair, patrol (3\u20134), delegation (5\u20138 plus 1 drow noble arms dealer), or battalion (10\u201340)", "special_abilities": null, "description": "With purple skin and white hair, drow are physically beautiful but merciless. Common drow form the majority of civilian and military forces and are governed by more powerful drow nobles. This strictly matriarchal culture leaves few opportunities for a common male, and training as an enforcer for a noble house or arms dealer is one of only a few ways a drow male can secure a somewhat comfortable life\u2014if not necessarily a long one.\r\n\r\n Drow are ruthless opponents, having no qualms about setting ambushes or luring enemies to locations where they have the upper hand. They regard ideals such as fairness and honor as pathetic gestures of lesser races, and consider all who hold such beliefs deserving of exploitation. Drow have no compunction about using other races as slaves and minions, using them as cannon fodder when exploring potentially dangerous new locations or as a line of defense that allows drow to flee to safety when an encounter turns against them.\r\n\r\n As their economy revolves primarily around retrieving, reverse engineering, and selling weaponry from the planet-ship they have claimed as their own, drow are known throughout the Pact Worlds for having some of the finest, most cutting-edge armaments available.

These individuals are referred to as drow nobles, and are most commonly born to other drow nobles within the powerful ruling houses through the aid of genetic-selection technology that is tightly controlled by those houses. However, it is not unheard of for a drow noble to be born to common parents without any genetic intervention.

When explorers from the Pact Worlds first arrived on Verlorr 2 decades ago, however, electrovores were given a new lease on life, as the travelers came on massive metal vessels coursing with the very nourishment the beasts sought. A few crept on board the various ships, and since then, \u201cconduit rats\u201d (as some spacefarers refer to them) have quickly multiplied, forming colonies of varying sizes everywhere from Absalom Station to the farthest reaches of the Vast.<br/><br/> An electrovore gains sustenance not from ingesting biological material but from the electrical currents that pulse through both mechanical devices and organic creatures. Xenobiologists have shown evidence that an electrovore\u2019s internal organs are unlike those of a normal animal\u2014it has no stomach, no intestines, and no liver. Instead, every cell of the creature acts as a tiny battery, providing the necessary impulses to move its muscles and power brain functions. In essence, an electrovore is composed almost entirely of nervous system. The creatures have quickly adapted to the artificial habitats of starships and space stations that course with their nourishment.<br/><br/> With a serpentine body covered in sparking spines and sprouting a pair of leathery wings, a typical electrovore is 3 feet long and weighs 25 pounds. An electrovore has three bright-blue visual sensors: two flanking its head and one situated on the bridge of its snout. Its wide mouth is full of sharp teeth, but it rarely uses them in combat, instead employing them to chew through wire casings. An electrovore prefers to slap and sting with its barbed tail when on the hunt.<br/><br/> A single electrovore poses little immediate threat to a starship or space station, but two or more reproduce at an alarming rate and can quickly overrun even the most experienced and best-equipped engineering team. The first signs of an electrovore infestation are usually power fluctuations in a remote, rarely traveled portion of a ship or decks already under repair or construction, but such deviations can be the result of anything from cosmic rays to a loose coupling or power being diverted to other systems. A gnawed cable or severed connector is generally the next indication of an electrovore\u2019s presence, but by then there are likely dozens and dozens of the creatures throughout the ship\u2019s crawlways, in its walls, and beneath its floors out of sight.<br/><br/> In their new habitats, electrovores are incredibly fecund, doubling in number in 1d6+5 weeks (assuming there are two or more to begin with). If left unchecked, a handful of the creatures on a space station or large ship can eventually overwhelm the crew\u2019s capacity to deal with them. As such, malicious space pirates and saboteurs sometimes release a pair of electrovores into a closed environment to disable their enemies\u2019 vessels, distract from other threats or operations, or sink the economic or resale value of commercial operations or salvaged ships. However, the electrovores just as often disable the ships of these pirates and saboteurs, making this a risky and unreliable tactic.<br/><br/> In addition to the direct damage an electrovore colony can deal to a ship\u2019s infrastructure, it can also wreak havoc on the vessel\u2019s systems when threatened. Full of siphoned electrical energy, a startled or cornered electrovore discharges this stored potential, often resulting in even more damage to computer systems and organic matter than the creature could normally manage in twice the time. Luckily, it takes some time for an electrovore to gather enough energy to perform this devastating attack.<br/><br/> Larger starships generally have enough redundancies built into their construction that it takes much longer for electrovore infestations to disable their key systems, though a sizable enough colony of the creatures can unleash incredible destruction in a surprisingly short amount of time in the right conditions. Even a starship with one electrovore on it is in danger of eventually being incapacitated. For each period of time for each size of starship listed in the table below, one of the vessel\u2019s systems (determined randomly) takes critical damage (<i>Starfinder Core Rulebook</i> 321). Of course, the more electrovores infesting a vessel, the faster they disable its systems, though it takes a minimum of 1 day for a starship to take a critical damage effect in this way.<br/><br/>"}, "Ellicoth": {"title": "Ellicoth", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 48", "cr": "9", "xp": "6400", "size": "Gargantuan", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "magical", "creature_subtype": "beast", "initiative": "+0", "senses": "blindsense (life) 60 ft., low-light vision", "perception": "+22", "aura": "of Radiation (Ex)", "hp": "145", "rp": null, "eac": "22", "kac": "24", "fort_save": "+13", "ref_save": "+13", "will_save": "+8", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": null, "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "50 ft.", "melee": "gore +22 (2d10+15 P) or soul drain +22 (see below)", "ranged": null, "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": null, "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+6", "dex": "+0", "con": "+4", "int": "-3", "wis": "+3", "cha": "+2", "skills": "Athletics +17, Intimidate +17, Survival +17", "languages": "Eoxian (can\u2019t speak any language)", "gear": null, "other_abilities": "no breath", "environment": "any plains or deserts (Eox)", "organization": "solitary, pair, or herd (3-6)", "special_abilities": "<b>Aura of Radiation (Ex)</b> Due to the environments in which they live, ellicoths absorb extreme levels of radiation, and have evolved the ability to store and redirect this energy without being harmed by it.

Its stocky body is covered with horns and growths, and its skin is heavily blistered and cracked from the radiation it absorbs and stores within itself, making it appear perpetually raw and burned. While some of this radiation comes from the cosmic rays that bombard Eox\u2019s surface due to its lack of a protective atmosphere, even more of it is absorbed from Eox\u2019s wastelands, as the creatures seem mysteriously drawn to those regions still heavily radioactive from the cataclysm that ravaged Eox ages ago.<br/><br/> Records from the bone sages report that ellicoths predate the nuclear disaster that befell Eox, indicating that at one point ellicoths were gentle herbivores whose long legs and lithe trunks allowed them to safely reach the luscious fruits atop tall spike-trunked jicobalan trees. During the disaster, however, several herds were caught in the backlash of magical energy, causing them to mutate. Today, the mournful ellicoths no longer eat vegetation or even breathe like normal animals. Instead, they siphon vital energy directly from other creatures and use it to sustain their own agonized existences. Ellicoths can survive just as easily on the necromantic energies that animate undead as on the soul energy of living creatures, and most of their diet consists of ghosts, zombies, and other spontaneously generated undead in Eox\u2019s wastelands. Occasionally, however, a stampede of desperate or enraged ellicoths will crash through the protective walls around Eoxian settlements and gorge in a feeding frenzy until the local military can mobilize to bring them down. While the bone sages are thus careful to keep local ellicoth populations in check, driving the most aggressive populations out into the distant wastes, most see the advantage of keeping a few around to remind citizens that even the undead need the protection of a strong government.<br/><br/> Not all bone sages are content to let ellicoths remain wild, however. Continuing a tradition that stretches back even before the Gap, several bone sages still employ fearsome ellicoth cavalries in their militias. From armored howdahs built onto and around the horns atop the creatures\u2019 broad backs, undead soldiers immune to ellicoths\u2019 aura of radiation rain destruction down on their opponents, guiding the beasts through magic or direct neurotech linkages. Despite the expense of keeping the creatures and the advantages presented by more conventional vehicles, ellicoths\u2019 ability to completely devour an opponent\u2019s life force doubles as a useful psychological weapon, and their spindly legs can support a surprising amount of weight, allowing for thick armor plates to be affixed to their hide or heavy weapons to be mounted on their horns.<br/><br/> Ellicoths are mammalian and give birth to live young one at a time, which mature to full size within a few years and can live for centuries. Rather than having a designated leader, each herd tends to follow whichever adult member is moving with the most purpose at any given time, leading to chaotic and unpredictable movements when threatened. Ellicoth corpses are extremely rare; when an ellicoth grows old and its internal organs begin to fail, it instinctively leaves the herd and heads for the most powerful source of radiation in the area\u2014usually the center of a radioactive waste\u2014and proceeds to lie down and sing its dirges loudly and continually until its body finally gives out. Once it does, unknown processes within its cells, possibly related to the storage of radiation, cause the corpse to suddenly and dramatically break down, transforming the creature into a puddle of radioactive ooze within hours.<br/><br/>"}, "Endbringer Devil (Dhalochar)": {"title": "Endbringer Devil (Dhalochar)", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 34", "cr": "19", "xp": "204800", "size": "Colossal", "alignment": "LE", "creature_type": "outsider", "creature_subtype": "devil", "initiative": "+6", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., see in darkness", "perception": "+32", "aura": null, "hp": "415", "rp": "6", "eac": "33", "kac": "35", "fort_save": "+20", "ref_save": "+20", "will_save": "+18", "defensive_abilities": "construct form", "immunities": "fire, poison", "resistances": "acid 10, cold 10", "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": "30", "damage_reduction": "15/good and magic", "speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Another favored hunting tactic is to drop down in a ring around an unsuspecting victim before closing in for the kill.<br/><br/> These furred quadrupeds are the size of large hounds, with muscular forelimbs and six-digit humanlike hands that assist in scaling trunks and hanging onto branches. Their powerful jaws and sharp teeth are capable of tearing into tough flesh, and their large, flaring nostrils help them pick up even the faintest scent. But eohis are not entirely dependent on scent; their keen eyes allow them to see well even in the dim light under the forest canopy.<br/><br/> Male eohis have darker fur, ranging from black to slate gray, while female eohis are usually light brown, tan, or brindled. Eohis give birth to live young, which are nursed by their mothers until their fangs grow in, usually in about 3 months. The young then feast on carcasses left behind by older eohis, but as they grow and learn to work cooperatively to take down living prey, they form their own hunting packs.<br/><br/> Millennia ago, the kishalee empire captured a handful of eohis and brought them to the cities of Nejeor VI (see page 62) to populate their zoos. The kishalee occasionally introduced new eohis to the captive animals to keep the gene pool viable, and the creatures became a popular attraction. When the kishalee civilization crumbled, though, these captive eohis were left to fend for themselves in their pens. Many of them died from lack of food; others perished when their host cities plummeted into the clouds. However, the eohis in Istamak (see page 38) survived by breaking out of their cages and eating many of the other animals in their zoo before eventually establishing a stable population in the city\u2019s park. Eventually, the kish (see page 58) in that city saw how useful eohis could be in a hunt and tamed some of them, training them to take down larger prey and to guard kish homes and livestock from the city\u2019s other predators.<br/><br/>"}, "Formian Warrior": {"title": "Formian Warrior", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 50", "cr": "3", "xp": "800", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "LN", "creature_type": "monstrous", "creature_subtype": "humanoid", "initiative": "+2 (+6 with hive mind)", "senses": "blindsense (scent) 30 ft., darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+8 (+12 with hive mind)", "aura": null, "hp": "39", "rp": null, "eac": "17", "kac": "20", "fort_save": "+5", "ref_save": "+3", "will_save": "+4", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": null, "resistances": "sonic 10", "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "40 ft.", "melee": "claw +11 (1d6+7 S) or stinger +11 (1d4+7 P plus formian toxin)", "ranged": "azimuth laser rifle +8 (1d8+3 F; critical burn 1d6)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "deadly grasp, fighting styles (guard)", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+4", "dex": "+2", "con": "+1", "int": "+0", "wis": "-1", "cha": "+0", "skills": "Acrobatics +13, Intimidate +8, Stealth +8", "languages": "Common; limited telepathy 60 ft.", "gear": "squad defiance series, azimuth laser rifle with 2 batteries (20 charges each)", "other_abilities": "armor training, hive mind", "environment": "any land or underground (Castrovel)", "organization": "solitary, pair, patrol (3\u201312), or band (5\u20138 plus 3\u201315 formian workers)", "special_abilities": "<b>Deadly Grasp (Ex)</b> When a formian warrior succeeds at a combat maneuver to maintain a grapple, it can make a melee attack with its stinger as a move action.<br/><br/> <b>Hive Mind (Ex)</b> Formians operate from a shared hive intelligence that allows them to communicate nearly instantaneously.

Force effects, however, function normally against a gray.<br/><br/> <b>Probe (Su)</b> A gray creates powerful psychic connections to creatures it touches, transferring information and sensations at terrifying speeds. A creature struck by a gray\u2019s touch (a melee attack targeting KAC) is staggered by sensory overload for 1d4 rounds unless it succeeds at a DC 15 Will save.<br/><br/> Alternatively, if the creature it touches is conscious, intelligent, and paralyzed, a gray can instead use a standard action to probe the creature\u2019s mind.

The target can resist this probing with a successful DC 15 Will save.

Those captors, though, have much in common no matter the specific circumstances or the species of the victim: an otherworldly presence, condescending interactions, and a sinister disregard for the agency and dignity of those they take as subjects for their experiments.<br/><br/> Grays communicate only telepathically, even among their own kind. Their faces and glassy black eyes show little emotion or reaction, and while graceful, they usually move with deliberate intention, often spending several moments in thought before committing to an action or movement. This inscrutability renders them enigmatic and disturbing to most other races.<br/><br/> Little is known about the grays\u2019 motivations, and to date no efforts have been successful at establishing diplomatic relationships with them.

Victims of their paralytic abductions are almost always returned mostly unharmed, though the sudden appearance of a series of scars or an inexplicable implant undermines the effects of the grays\u2019 ability to erase memories of the experience. Researchers wonder at the end goals of this accumulation of knowledge and what purposes the information gleaned may serve in the meantime. Some fringe scientists believe grays are preparing for an eventual all-out invasion, while others posit they are simply curious about us, but their alien mindsets lead them to sate this inquisitiveness in disturbing ways.<br/><br/> Once rare enough that reports of their abductions were written off as conspiracy and delusion, encounters with grays have become disturbingly more common with the advent of Drift travel. Their sleek, disk-shaped starships lurk in the dark corners of the Drift, appearing seemingly out of nowhere to confront vessels with inattentive or unwary crews. Much like the grays themselves, their ships are designed less for offense and more for evading and subduing their targets, employing tractor beams and EMP weapons to disable and control a vessel, preserving its crew as test subjects.

Examination of the surviving art and artifacts on Hallas suggests hallajins considered their small world the center of the universe, with other worlds and stars revolving around it, and saw the idea of leaving it as heresy. This may explain why hallajins are rarely seen away from Hallas. Though actual answers are few, historians believe that those occasional hallajins sighted on other worlds may be descendants of an ancient schism in their society that happened before the Gap or the establishment of the protective cordon.<br/><br/> Hallajins can use their light leap ability to appear and vanish at will, fly swiftly, pass through material barriers, and cross vast distances in the blink of an eye. Early adepts of Arkanen discovered that hallajins either will not or cannot pass through intense electrical fields, and they found that electricity appears to cause hallajins pain\u2014 or at least that they recoil from it. Researchers theorize that electricity interferes in some way with the creatures\u2019 energy matrices. This weakness provides a means of shielding against hallajin intrusions, although intense electrical energy fields also appear to draw the creatures\u2019 attention, perhaps being especially visible to their senses. Large concentrations of minds, particularly emotional ones, seem to likewise draw the creatures, and researchers must keep their minds carefully shielded with specialized armor or magical protections.<br/><br/> What hallajins want, if anything, is unclear. The little of their culture recovered from ancient ruins and brief interactions indicates that their advancement to their current form was part of an intentional cultural drive to attempt to reach collective godhood. Whether the creatures intentionally stopped at their current state or simply couldn\u2019t progress any further remains unknown. Today, hallajins appear capricious and intensely curious, and their behavior is unpredictable. They are almost always encountered singly, although small groups of them have been sighted in the distance on Hallas. Yet despite their apparently solitary behavior, they remain in near-constant communication with others of their kind across vast distances. They don\u2019t appear to understand or respond to any known spoken languages, and attempts to contact them telepathically usually end in disaster. The hallajins sometimes initiate contact, telepathically \u201cspeaking\u201d in an unsettling chorus of voices to their listeners, but rarely say anything intelligible. Hallajins occasionally follow visitors to their home planets, exercising their telekinetic abilities to shift objects around or cause random poltergeistlike phenomena, sometimes dangerously. In a few cases, the energy beings turn suddenly hostile, attacking with bursts of searing energy or overloading victims\u2019 minds. Interestingly, hallajins appear incapable of recognizing mechanical constructs as anything but objects, even if such creatures are intelligent.<br/><br/> The unexplained behavior, strange powers, and eerie appearance of hallajins lead some intelligent creatures to revere them as examples of universal forces or enlightened beings. A few visiting scholars have started single-minded cults around the creatures, believing that hallajins hold the secrets to assisting corporeal beings in attaining a similarly evolved state, if only they can be persuaded to share them. Some think this is accomplished by attracting the attention of the lights of Hallas, and then communing and proving their worthiness in some fashion, while others think they can trick or even force the secret from hallajins. Hallajin cults tend to be obsessed with ancient artifacts from Hallas and strange electrical mechanisms designed to summon, communicate with, or even trap the objects of their worship. Though many fear the consequences of allowing such groups contact with the creatures, so far the Pact Worlds overseers have continued to grant these fanatics unrestricted access to Hallas.<br/><br/>"}, "Hesper": {"title": "Hesper", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 62", "cr": "2", "xp": "600", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "CN", "creature_type": "fey", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+1", "senses": "low-light vision", "perception": "+7", "aura": null, "hp": "21", "rp": null, "eac": "13", "kac": "12", "fort_save": "+3", "ref_save": "+3", "will_save": "+5", "defensive_abilities": "reactor sprite", "immunities": "fire, radiation", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": "vulnerable to cold", "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "30 ft.", "melee": "mutating touch +3 (see below)", "ranged": null, "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": null, "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+0", "dex": "+1", "con": "+2", "int": "+0", "wis": "+1", "cha": "+4", "skills": "Diplomacy +12, Engineering +7, Physical Science +12", "languages": "Common", "gear": null, "other_abilities": null, "environment": "any starship or urban", "organization": "solitary, pair, or clique (3\u201312)", "special_abilities": "<b>Mutating Touch (Su)</b> A hesper can deliver an enormous dose of radiation with a touch, triggering sudden mutations and pain in living creatures.

Millennia of ongoing strife between the planet\u2019s formians and lashuntas bombarded these primeval ksariks with psychic energy, and only decades before the two factions\u2019 recent peace deal, the plants began exhibiting rudimentary intelligence and a predatory drive. In an unsettlingly small number of generations, ksariks have developed a pack mentality, low cunning, and the preternatural ability to adopt competitors\u2019 strengths.<br/><br/> A typical ksarik is a 12-foot-long quadruped made up of dense plant matter, including specialized tissues such as powerful tendons, woody internal supports that resemble bones, and flexible sheets of lignin that serve as a form of armor. Its head is immense and stocky, comprising approximately a dozen feeding tendrils that obscure its underdeveloped mouthparts. Its eyestalks project from either side of its head, providing a wide range of vision that sacrifices much of its ability to see targets immediately in front of it. To make up for this, a ksarik\u2019s feeding tendrils are covered in an array of unusual sensory organs: some can discern the source of smells, while others sense movement and changes in light.<br/><br/> Originally occupying a niche between decomposers and scavengers, ksariks adapted to sniff out carrion and digest every piece of a rotting corpse. A ksarik\u2019s body produces a steady supply of several different acids that help it break down food into a more manageable form, and modern ksariks regularly employ these acids in self-defense and hunting. The plants also have numerous thorns that grow along their legs and back. Botanists theorize that these also served as selfdefense when the ksariks were slower-moving creatures that resided lower on the food chain. Now, however, ksariks use these thorns as a form of reproduction, firing them into live prey and infecting those creatures with spores that gradually grow into nascent ksariks that feed on the host, and then painfully burrow out of the flesh days later. The spores must be fertilized beforehand in a process that resembles sexual congress between two ksariks, leaving both with a supply of seeds that remain viable for months afterward.<br/><br/> The most fearsome of the ksarik\u2019s abilities is its capability of extracting and assimilating other creatures\u2019 genetic codes, temporarily mimicking its prey\u2019s adaptations. Studies suggest this ability is as much tied to a ksarik\u2019s physical characteristics as it is some rudimentary psychic ability that allows the plant to adjust its body in accordance with a stolen genetic blueprint. Most of this code is unstable within the plants, meaning ksariks can rarely maintain an adaptation for more than a minute or, at most, a few hours. However, trace amounts of foreign DNA remain, and it appears that parents are able to pass lesser versions of their adopted abilities to their offspring.<br/><br/> This enhanced evolution has drawn ksariks into otherwise unsuitable habitats on Castrovel, where they have quickly outcompeted other species, even driving several of them to extinction. Due to this explosive growth, most lashuntas consider them an ecological nuisance, though xenobiologists have lobbied against the species\u2019 eradication until it can be properly studied\u2014especially now that the ksariks have begun absorbing and demonstrating signs of rudimentary culture.<br/><br/> The most notable evidence of this cultural development is the lilting melodies ksariks sing when in close proximity to one another. Scientists have yet to discover the purpose of these songs, as their best efforts to determine if they provide any information to the plants has failed. What\u2019s more, their attempts to replicate the sounds only lead to angering nearby ksariks, the creatures being seemingly affronted by the endeavor. These sounds appear to emanate directly from a ksarik\u2019s skin instead of any particular orifice, a fact that opponents of ksarik conservation hold as proof that the plants aren\u2019t purposefully making them. Of course, those on the other side of the argument believe it doesn\u2019t matter from where the songs come."}, "Kyokor": {"title": "Kyokor", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 72", "cr": "20", "xp": "307200", "size": "Colossal", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "magical", "creature_subtype": "beast", "initiative": "+6", "senses": "blindsense (thought) 120 ft., sense the masses", "perception": "+34", "aura": null, "hp": "485", "rp": null, "eac": "35", "kac": "37", "fort_save": "+23", "ref_save": "+19", "will_save": "+21", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": null, "resistances": "cold 30, fire 30", "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "100 ft., swim 100 ft.", "melee": "bite +35 (4d12+29 P) or claw +35 (4d12+29 S) or slam +35 (8d6+29 B)", "ranged": null, "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "demolish structures, enthrall victims", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+9", "dex": "+6", "con": "+12", "int": "+6", "wis": "+5", "cha": "+4", "skills": "Intimidate +39, Sense Motive +34, Survival +34", "languages": "Ancient Daimalkan, Common", "gear": null, "other_abilities": "massive, water breathing", "environment": "any (Daimalko)", "organization": "solitary", "special_abilities": "<b>Demolish Structures (Ex)</b> A kyokor has an exoskeleton that is harder than most metals, and it can therefore use its body against urban structures with deadly effect.

They have occasionally been observed using these grotesque tendrils in those rare situations in which they need fine manipulation ability (though they may have others uses as well). Certainly the jagged crablike claws on their arms are useless for grabbing anything smaller than a boulder; these are used almost exclusively to spear and smash. A kyokor has an armored skull with a strangely elongated chin, tiny glowing eyes peeking out from a cavernous gash, and sharp growths like a crown of teeth rising from the top of its head. A single kyokor is typically about 150 feet tall and weighs more than 20,000 tons.<br/><br/> Although most Daimalkans who have ventured to the planet\u2019s surface have seen at least one kyokor from afar, only a handful of the bravest explorers and heroes have ever seen one up close. Most known information about these colossi comes from bloodstained, hastily scrawled records created during the Awakening (the planetwide cataclysm that released the kyokors and other colossi from their slumber deep within the oceans). According to these dossiers, kyokors have the ability to sense large populations of humanoids from incredible distances and to grip their victims\u2019 minds in fear as they gleefully destroy whole cities. The latter ability leaves populations at the mercy of the beasts, and likely contributed to how quickly Daimalko fell into ruins during the Awakening. It\u2019s also said that kyokors are capable of speech, but that no one alive has heard a kyokor\u2019s voice.<br/><br/> Kyokors target population centers, and they seem to equally revel in the fear they produce as they demolish buildings and snatch up tiny humanoid snacks to eat.

Regardless of their mortal forms or alterations thereto, all marooned ones are distinguishable from similar undead by their glowing, ice-blue eyes and mouths that open unnaturally wide in cheek-splitting and jaw-cracking screams of fury.<br/><br/>Marooned ones inevitably remain near the place of their abandonment, ironically assuring that nobody recovers their remains or otherwise disturbs their final resting place without paying the price. While they have nearly as much intelligence as they did in life, their original personalities erode quickly under the corrosive power of the malicious energies reanimating them, and they use their cognition and what remains of their memories in service of a single purpose: causing other living creatures to suffer the same fate as they did.<br/><br/> The only time one of these undead feels something close to pleasure is when it forces or tricks a group of intruders in its territory into leaving one of their own behind. The marooned one avoids killing this castaway if possible, instead attempting to bond with the victim over their shared fate, increasing the chance that the intruder rises as a marooned one when it dies. This bonding can seem strangely caring; as soon as its victim\u2019s fate is sealed, a marooned one gives every appearance of sympathizing with its prey, even giving advice on how to continue to survive in their current environment as long as possible. This emotion is hollow, however, for a marooned one can never be convinced to allow a victim to escape, and what personality the undead manages to manifest during these conversations inevitably fades again with the victim\u2019s death and rebirth as a fellow undead. Once such a transformation occurs, the marooned ones show little interest in one another, waiting in total silence for more of the living to wander into their shared territory.<br/><br/> Marooned ones can operate any equipment they could in life and, as a representative sample of spacefarers, are often quite technologically savvy. They are frequently armed with weaponry appropriate to their earlier station, but they use such arms mostly to threaten and intimidate, and they prefer to strangle victims to death if marooning them isn\u2019t possible. Their technological acumen is also a major part of their threat, as starship crews sometimes don\u2019t realize they\u2019re in danger until a marooned one has already quietly and permanently disabled their starship, trapping them in the creature\u2019s territory.<br/><br/> Marooned ones are most often found in the hulks of dead starships and other places where spacefarers have been left to die slowly, adrift in the black due to mechanical failure or malicious pirates. Yet marooned ones can also arise in perfectly habitable but dangerously isolated regions: colonists and explorers stranded on new worlds, soldiers abandoned by allies on a battlefield\u2014anyone who dies after being left behind can potentially turn into a marooned one."}, "Medium Elemental": {"title": "Medium Elemental", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 46", "cr": "3", "xp": "800", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "outsider", "creature_subtype": "elemental", "initiative": "+2", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+8", "aura": null, "hp": "40", "rp": null, "eac": "14", "kac": "16", "fort_save": "+7", "ref_save": "+5", "will_save": "+2", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": "elemental immunities", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "20 ft.", "melee": "slam +12 (1d6+7 B)", "ranged": null, "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": null, "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+4", "dex": "+2", "con": "+1", "int": "-3", "wis": "+0", "cha": "+0", "skills": "Acrobatics +8, Athletics +8", "languages": null, "gear": null, "other_abilities": null, "environment": "any", "organization": "any", "special_abilities": null, "description": "An elemental is a creature native to one of the four Elemental Planes that is composed entirely of that plane\u2019s element.

Creatures without a sense of sight and other mountain eels are immune to this effect.", "description": "Due to some quirk of parallel evolution, these massive creatures have features resembling their waterborne kin\u2019s, especially their gaping maws filled with terrible teeth. On the other hand, mountain eels have large, arthropodan compound eyes, and their coloring tends to range from dark to very dark green. Mountain eels dwell on the slopes of the mountains of Castrovel, gliding quietly between the trees as they hunt for prey. The gaze of a mountain eel paralyzes most creatures, allowing the beast to run its victims down and feast on their corpses. A typical mountain eel is about 5 feet tall but 60 feet from nostrils to tail if laid out in a straight line, though it constantly squirms and contorts its body. Despite its size, a mountain eel is very light, weighing approximately 300 pounds.<br/><br/> Mountain eels are carnivores, and they prefer their meals to be freshly dead before they tear into the flesh. However, they need to eat close to their weight in food every day, so they have been known to devour longdead creatures if enough meat remains on the bones. If a mountain eel has sated its appetite before completely consuming its prey, it simply leaves the body to rot, sometimes coming back to it the following day or leaving it for scavengers (or other mountain eels). Mountain eels get almost all of their hydration from eating, and they tend to avoid larger bodies of water, though it isn\u2019t uncommon to spot a mountain eel splashing through a small stream or turning its face up toward the sky during a rainstorm. Despite their massive bulk, mountain eels are surprisingly quiet in most of their movements, as they distribute their weight across the length of their bodies using their multitude of winged armlike appendages. The creatures also use these arms to push underbrush and small trees to one side as they travel, to avoid the telling sounds of snapping branches and crunching twigs. As a mountain eel closes in on its prey, however, it abandons all attempts at subtlety to gather up enough speed to crush its targets.<br/><br/> In addition to their uncannily quiet locomotion, mountain eels only very infrequently vocalize in any way. After years of study, scientists have discovered that the creatures\u2019 vocal chords are almost completely vestigial. After noticing dozens of small scent glands located just under their scales during their dissections, these researchers posited that mountain eels communicate with one another through smells. Xenobiologists are still unsure exactly how this ability works, but mountain eel hunters and others who live in mountain eel territory have learned that certain smells mean danger.<br/><br/> Mountain eels give birth to live offspring, a messy process that produces a handful of nearly translucent, mucus-covered elvers that are each almost as big as a human. Though newly born mountain elvers\u2019 size might allow them to hunt right away, their fearsome fangs don\u2019t grow in for several weeks. During this time, the parent eels bring small chunks of meat to their offspring, which swallow the food whole. As they start feeding, their pigmentation slowly comes in, and when they do finally develop their teeth, the elvers can take down their own, albeit smaller, prey. It takes several more years of constant eating before an elver becomes a full adult mountain eel and another few years before it reaches sexual maturity.<br/><br/> Judging on appearance alone, it is difficult to tell an elderly mountain eel from an adult. A mountain eel close to the end of its life tends to move a little slower, however, and the odors it emanates become more flowery. Once it becomes unable to catch enough food, the beast slowly starves to death. A mountain eel\u2019s corpse quickly succumbs to the elements, rotting faster than most other dead flesh and attracting teeming swarms of insects. Even a dead mountain eel\u2019s bones seem to disappear after a few days in Castrovelian weather; they are often mistaken for fallen logs covered in a thick layer of bright-green moss.<br/><br/> Some lashuntas and formians enjoy hunting mountain eels, despite (and many would say because of) the danger they pose. These thrill seekers equip themselves with sniper rifles and veils before setting out for the planet\u2019s mountainous areas. The eels leave very little trace of their movements through the foliage, so hunters must be on the lookout for partially chewed carcasses and other signs of mountain eel habitation, such as an increased insect population. Once they find one of the beasts, they make sure to isolate it before striking. Successful lashunta hunters skin the dead eels to make items of clothing, which they sometimes enchant (like the items presented below). Formians, on the other hand, enjoy cooking mountain eel meat, using an array of exotic spices."}, "Necrovite": {"title": "Necrovite", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 80", "cr": "13", "xp": "25600", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "NE", "creature_type": "undead", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+3", "senses": "blindsight (life) 60 ft., darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+23", "aura": "ue Aura (Su)", "hp": "186", "rp": "5", "eac": "29", "kac": "30", "fort_save": "+12", "ref_save": "+12", "will_save": "+18", "defensive_abilities": "fast healing 10, rejuvenation (1d8 days)", "immunities": "cold, electricity, undead immunities", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.

The most powerful spellcasters among these survivors combined their advanced technology with the ancient magical traditions of lichdom to achieve immortality in the form of eternal undeath.

Crafted with advanced user interfaces mimicking moderate intelligence, but without any of the emotions, unpredictability, or bias of a true AI or sentient creature, security bots are an eminently practical, reasonable solution to a wide variety of security needs. Unlike full-on military models, security robots usually come preprogrammed with certain fail-safes preventing them from engaging in violence beyond what\u2019s necessary for the protection of their assigned population or property, making them a go-to option for police forces, corporations, and even wealthy individuals looking for peace of mind.\r\n\r\n One of the cheapest and most common types of security robot is the observer. Observer-class bots are usually small, flying robots designed primarily to record and report specific unsavory activities for later review by their owners, though they are also equipped to fend off minor threats. Whether buzzing through the access ducts of secure facilities or hovering over crowded marketplaces, observers are nearly ubiquitous in some advanced settlements. On Absalom Station, the most prominent brand is AbadarCorp\u2019s VizAll, a flying orb with gentle contours designed to put citizens at ease, with a central eye, stubby fins, and relentlessly cheerful speech patterns. Aballon\u2019s Sunward Corporation produces the more disconcerting Arbitron, whose insectile form mimics those of the resident anacites, while Triaxus\u2019s Bluescale Industries crafts theirs to resemble tiny, mechanical drakes. Regardless of their shape, however, observers are known for their convenience, but they are infamous for their limited nuance\u2014a problem for owners who forget their own security passphrase. Some of the cheapest models also have faulty programming that causes them to develop personality quirks, making a particular bot act especially aggressive, friendly, or even dejected.\r\n\r\n Patrol-class security robots are more humanoid in shape, standing about 6 feet tall with integrated armaments that keep the robots\u2019 limbs free to apprehend offenders and engage in close combat. Given their deadlier weaponry and tougher armor plating, patrol-class security robots (sometimes simply called \u201cpatrol bots\u201d) are more regulated in their sale and use. They are found mostly in large space stations and corporate facilities under government or syndicate control. As with observer-class robots, these models run the gamut from four-armed Idaran Peacekeepers to the artistic Castrovelian Linewalkers that guard against dangerous jungle beasts, yet the overwhelming industry leader is AbadarCorp\u2019s Town Guard series. With blank, circular faces of glass or glowing energy and cleanly contoured limbs capable of folding up for easy storage, AbadarCorp\u2019s patrol bot is a triumph of industrial design and defense. This model\u2019s reputation has been further boosted due to the fact that it\u2019s the only model of patrol bot currently used by Absalom Station\u2019s government, with many going straight into service from the corporation\u2019s manufactories in the Spike.\r\n\r\n Unfortunately, not all security bots end up working for law-abiding corporations or state governments. Various planets in the Pact Worlds system have their own rules about who is or is not licensed to own a security robot, and the Pact Worlds government generally finds it easier to look the other way than to get embroiled in the contentious issues of rights-to- weapons and planetary sovereignty. As a result, it\u2019s not difficult for individuals to purchase security robots entirely unregulated on the black market, albeit at a high cost. In cases where a world outlaws such sales, these models are usually formerly legal models that have been stolen and cracked by hacker gangs, while in other places corporations quietly sell to known criminal enterprises without asking questions. Such security robots are sometimes marked by their owners to show their \u201callegiance\u201d\u2014they might be painted with gang symbols or have their heads replaced with disturbing mannequin busts. Other groups maintain their robots\u2019 official appearances, the better to carry out kidnappings and extortion. Because of this, passersby occasionally stumble across pitched firefights between squads of similar-looking security robots. Those who wish to get involved must be careful to identify each side\u2019s master, as they could find themselves unintentionally taking sides in a gang war.\r\n\r\n Though both observer and patrol models have safeguards to protect against it, glitches can occasionally develop in a security robot\u2019s firmware, often the result of massive damage sustained during a firefight or improper diagnostics after such an altercation. In such cases, the glitch can override the bot\u2019s usual baselevel programming regarding tiers of force and the logic of conflict escalation, or even its protocol to protect the innocent. This can result in a bloody rampage, with the robot either going berserk over perceived violation of nonexistent laws, or technically following the law but executing lethal punishment for even the smallest infraction. Even worse, an infected patrol bot\u2019s nanites can carry its corrupted code like a virus, turning other security robots rogue. When this occurs, manufacturers like AbadarCorp are usually quick to hire discreet \u201ccontractors\u201d to deal with the menace (as maintaining their own strike-and-disassembly force would publicly acknowledge the threat)."}, "Occult Zombie": {"title": "Occult Zombie", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 114", "cr": "1", "xp": "400", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "NE", "creature_type": "undead", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+2", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+5", "aura": null, "hp": "24", "rp": null, "eac": "11", "kac": "13", "fort_save": "+3", "ref_save": "+3", "will_save": "+3", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": "undead immunities", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": "staggered", "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": "5/magic", "speed": "30 ft.", "melee": "slam +8 (1d6+5 B)", "ranged": null, "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": null, "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+4", "dex": "+2", "con": "\u2014", "int": "\u2014", "wis": "+1", "cha": "+0", "skills": "Athletics +10", "languages": null, "gear": null, "other_abilities": "mindless, unliving", "environment": "any", "organization": "solitary, pair, pack (3\u201312), or horde (13+)", "special_abilities": "<b>Staggered (Ex)</b> An occult zombie is always considered staggered and can never take more than a single move or standard action in a round.

As creatures with no motivations of their own, undead minions can also be found leaderless in the remains of ruined structures on planetary surfaces, adrift in derelict spacecraft, and even floating through the void of space. Whether encountered as servants of a mastermind who coordinates their movements or as a mindless threat in the wake of a cataclysmic disaster, undead minions are always a force to be reckoned with and a scourge to the living.\r\n\r\n Though there are countless types of mindless undead who serve as minions, the most common are cybernetic zombies, occult zombies, and skeletal undead. Both occult zombies and skeletal undead are animated by magical or supernatural forces and created either in dark necromantic rituals (including the \r\n\r\n spell) or by strange and mysterious reactions between the Material and Negative Energy Planes. Cybernetic zombies, on the other hand, arise as the result of technological implants that continue to function after their hosts have died, causing the body to act in a sad, shambling imitation of real life. Without control from an external force, these three kinds of undead simply go through the motions of their former lives, without reason, purpose, or the promise of an end to their miserable existences.\r\n\r\n In the Pact Worlds, most undead hail from the dead world of Eox and were created by the bone sages, though zombies and skeletal creatures are also found among the wreckage of ancient battlefields on Akiton and the enigmatic, alien structures on Aucturn. In contrast, cybernetic zombies are most often found on worlds with high levels of technological development, such as Aballon, Castrovel, and Verces.\r\n\r\n Those cultists of Urgathoa who see undeath as the pinnacle of being surround themselves with undead minions, both to use their abilities to terrorize innocent folk and to study their physiology in order to become undead themselves. While these worshipers would prefer to become more intelligent undead creatures, they often find that their fate is to rise up as a skeleton or zombie. Priests of Pharasma, on the other hand, often go out of their way to destroy all undead creatures, especially their mindless minions.\r\n\r\n Undead minions can be formed from the corpses of any type of creature, though most of those appearing in folklore from across the galaxy are animated versions of whatever culture is telling the tale. Humanoids tell of ambulatory corpses rising from their ritual burial grounds, while aberrations, dragons, and magical beasts have their own legends of mindless dead of their own species returning to plague the living. Whatever the undead creatures\u2019 original form, they often maintain natural attacks and other physical characteristics of their living counterparts even in undeath, though their mindless nature means they lose the ability to carry out complex tactics, conduct intricate or detailed tasks, and cast spells or take other mentally engaging actions.

They magically project electromagnetic fields that shield them from the effects of the vacuum as well as from the particulate rings and dense atmospheres of the gas giants in which they usually feed, extracting energy and nutrients with their energy baleen. Oma are most often seen traveling alone, though there are regions of the Pact Worlds system where pods of oma are known to migrate together on a particular, if mysterious, schedule. Rarely, massive numbers of oma gather in the rings of a planet and put on an incredible show, their energy fields intermingling and reacting with local gases to light up swaths of space in a multicolored spectacle. A typical oma is 150 feet long and weighs 250 tons.<br/><br/>The most commonly known\u2014and least understood\u2014feature of oma is their starsong: a haunting telepathic melody that can be perceived thousands of miles away, even across the void of space. While most describe starsong as slow, mournful, and crooning, none ever agree on the finer details of a particular oma song, which suggests that each listener hears something different. Attempts to decipher concrete meaning from these tonal poems have so far eluded even the most brilliant magic and linguistics experts, as the oma speak in riddles that even they don\u2019t always appear to understand. Scholars and cryptolinguists among the glowing (and completely unrelated) poet-whales of Triaxus\u2019s arctic seas claim that the patterns represent a surprisingly complete oral history of the universe, albeit a highly stylized and nonchronological version. Whatever the content of the songs, even the saltiest of spacefarers can become tearily nostalgic when they recall their first experience hearing the haunting sound in the silence between worlds.<br/><br/> Most reported interactions with oma have affirmed their docile nature, and many experienced spacefarers believe that the titanic creatures have a benevolent streak and that sighting one is a sign of good luck and favorable trade ahead. More than one crew of a disabled starship has reported being found by a passing oma, which then herded the ship back to civilized space. Once its temporary charges are safe again among their kind, the oma bids farewell with slow somersaults and cryptic starsong. However, those few that have attempted to hunt oma for sport have found them more than capable of defending themselves; the massive beasts can unleash a targeted burst of energy that disables most modern starship power cores. This has not gone unnoticed by various governments, who make periodic (and so far unsuccessful) attempts to reverse engineer and weaponize this ability. Oma are also capable of swallowing small starships (such as fighters and interceptors) whole; some do it accidentally as they feed, but most only when provoked."}, "Orocoran Ichor Lord": {"title": "Orocoran Ichor Lord", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 90", "cr": "9", "xp": "6400", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "aberration", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+4", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+17", "aura": null, "hp": "120", "rp": "1", "eac": "21", "kac": "22", "fort_save": "+8", "ref_save": "+8", "will_save": "+14 (+16 vs. mind-affecting effects)", "defensive_abilities": "unflankable", "immunities": null, "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "30 ft.", "melee": "proboscis +15 (3d4+9 P; critical bleed 1d6)", "ranged": "projectile vomit +17 (2d6+9 A plus hallucinate)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": null, "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": "(CL 9th)", "str": "+0", "dex": "+4", "con": "+3", "int": "+2", "wis": "+6", "cha": "+3", "skills": "Intimidate +22, Mysticism +22, Sense Motive +17", "languages": "Aklo, Common (can\u2019t speak any language); limited telepathy 60 ft.", "gear": null, "other_abilities": null, "environment": "any (Aucturn)", "organization": "solitary or congregation (1 ichor lord plus 10\u201320 orocorans)", "special_abilities": "<b>Hallucinate (Ex)</b> An orocoran\u2019s stomach fluids are laced with the narcotic black ichor of Aucturn.

In addition to feeding the orocorans, these eldritch fluids also act as a powerful narcotic, filling the orocorans with euphoric hallucinations. Orocorans call this dream state \u201cwomb mind,\u201d and they believe that it allows them to commune directly with the gestating consciousness of the planet itself. Indeed, there may be some truth to this idea, as even those orocorans not actively dreaming can use the ichor lingering in their systems to tap into this mystical consciousness and receive vague prophetic advice regarding their actions. Orocorans can usually be found wherever the veins of ichor flow thickest, either defending their hallucinogenic watering hole or simply lying sprawled in the grips of drug-induced stupors.

Crafted with advanced user interfaces mimicking moderate intelligence, but without any of the emotions, unpredictability, or bias of a true AI or sentient creature, security bots are an eminently practical, reasonable solution to a wide variety of security needs. Unlike full-on military models, security robots usually come preprogrammed with certain fail-safes preventing them from engaging in violence beyond what\u2019s necessary for the protection of their assigned population or property, making them a go-to option for police forces, corporations, and even wealthy individuals looking for peace of mind.\r\n\r\n One of the cheapest and most common types of security robot is the observer. Observer-class bots are usually small, flying robots designed primarily to record and report specific unsavory activities for later review by their owners, though they are also equipped to fend off minor threats. Whether buzzing through the access ducts of secure facilities or hovering over crowded marketplaces, observers are nearly ubiquitous in some advanced settlements. On Absalom Station, the most prominent brand is AbadarCorp\u2019s VizAll, a flying orb with gentle contours designed to put citizens at ease, with a central eye, stubby fins, and relentlessly cheerful speech patterns. Aballon\u2019s Sunward Corporation produces the more disconcerting Arbitron, whose insectile form mimics those of the resident anacites, while Triaxus\u2019s Bluescale Industries crafts theirs to resemble tiny, mechanical drakes. Regardless of their shape, however, observers are known for their convenience, but they are infamous for their limited nuance\u2014a problem for owners who forget their own security passphrase. Some of the cheapest models also have faulty programming that causes them to develop personality quirks, making a particular bot act especially aggressive, friendly, or even dejected.\r\n\r\n Patrol-class security robots are more humanoid in shape, standing about 6 feet tall with integrated armaments that keep the robots\u2019 limbs free to apprehend offenders and engage in close combat. Given their deadlier weaponry and tougher armor plating, patrol-class security robots (sometimes simply called \u201cpatrol bots\u201d) are more regulated in their sale and use. They are found mostly in large space stations and corporate facilities under government or syndicate control. As with observer-class robots, these models run the gamut from four-armed Idaran Peacekeepers to the artistic Castrovelian Linewalkers that guard against dangerous jungle beasts, yet the overwhelming industry leader is AbadarCorp\u2019s Town Guard series. With blank, circular faces of glass or glowing energy and cleanly contoured limbs capable of folding up for easy storage, AbadarCorp\u2019s patrol bot is a triumph of industrial design and defense. This model\u2019s reputation has been further boosted due to the fact that it\u2019s the only model of patrol bot currently used by Absalom Station\u2019s government, with many going straight into service from the corporation\u2019s manufactories in the Spike.\r\n\r\n Unfortunately, not all security bots end up working for law-abiding corporations or state governments. Various planets in the Pact Worlds system have their own rules about who is or is not licensed to own a security robot, and the Pact Worlds government generally finds it easier to look the other way than to get embroiled in the contentious issues of rights-to- weapons and planetary sovereignty. As a result, it\u2019s not difficult for individuals to purchase security robots entirely unregulated on the black market, albeit at a high cost. In cases where a world outlaws such sales, these models are usually formerly legal models that have been stolen and cracked by hacker gangs, while in other places corporations quietly sell to known criminal enterprises without asking questions. Such security robots are sometimes marked by their owners to show their \u201callegiance\u201d\u2014they might be painted with gang symbols or have their heads replaced with disturbing mannequin busts. Other groups maintain their robots\u2019 official appearances, the better to carry out kidnappings and extortion. Because of this, passersby occasionally stumble across pitched firefights between squads of similar-looking security robots. Those who wish to get involved must be careful to identify each side\u2019s master, as they could find themselves unintentionally taking sides in a gang war.\r\n\r\n Though both observer and patrol models have safeguards to protect against it, glitches can occasionally develop in a security robot\u2019s firmware, often the result of massive damage sustained during a firefight or improper diagnostics after such an altercation. In such cases, the glitch can override the bot\u2019s usual baselevel programming regarding tiers of force and the logic of conflict escalation, or even its protocol to protect the innocent. This can result in a bloody rampage, with the robot either going berserk over perceived violation of nonexistent laws, or technically following the law but executing lethal punishment for even the smallest infraction. Even worse, an infected patrol bot\u2019s nanites can carry its corrupted code like a virus, turning other security robots rogue. When this occurs, manufacturers like AbadarCorp are usually quick to hire discreet \u201ccontractors\u201d to deal with the menace (as maintaining their own strike-and-disassembly force would publicly acknowledge the threat)."}, "Radiation Drake": {"title": "Radiation Drake", "flavor_text": "Starfinder #8: Escape from the Prison Moon pg. 56", "cr": "9", "xp": "6400", "size": "Large", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "dragon", "creature_subtype": null, "initiative": "+4", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., low-light vision", "perception": "+17", "aura": null, "hp": "145", "rp": null, "eac": "22", "kac": "24", "fort_save": "+13", "ref_save": "+13", "will_save": "+10", "defensive_abilities": null, "immunities": "paralysis, radiation, sleep", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": "5/magic", "speed": "30 ft., fly 60 ft.

Time breaks all things down, as all creation marches inexorably toward chaos and oblivion.<br/><br/> Many eons ago, a long-vanished civilization took offense to this cosmic truth and conceived of an all-purpose gel\u2014equal parts magic and nanotechnology\u2014that could repair nearly anything, including flesh. At some point in that civilization\u2019s history, perhaps due to some industrial accident, a vat of this gel gained a limited sentience and began to reproduce in dark corners and sewers.<br/><br/> Despite all their advanced technology, the civilization eventually collapsed\u2014perhaps even as a result of being overrun by their own creation\u2014but the sentient gel survived, hitching rides on the hulls and in the cramped cargo bays of their progenitor race\u2019s scattering survivors. Released onto other worlds, the gel continued to evolve and adapt, becoming the scrounging, hoarding blobs of protoplasm now generally referred to as scavenger slimes. These oozes now lurk in ruins across the galaxy, gluing together elaborate, snaillike shells for themselves from detritus and jury-rigging whatever technology they find into half-functioning weaponry.<br/><br/>Scavenger slimes are lumps of protoplasm measuring about 6 feet across. Though mindless, they have an intuitive understanding of order and technological systems, allowing them to patch or repair nearly anything they encounter, though rarely into a form as reliable or attractive as it may have once been. Actually using these items is often beyond them\u2014 an ooze might rebuild a hovercar, but have no idea how to operate it, unable to even grasp its purpose. Similarly, an ooze might repair a datapad, yet have no concept what the sights and sounds it displays are attempting to communicate. The sole exception to this principle is weapons: through whatever mechanism, scavenger slimes long ago gained the ability to direct and trigger the weapons they rebuild, instinctively understanding what they\u2019re for and how to use them in their own defense, treating them like specially adapted limbs.<br/><br/> The key to a scavenger slime\u2019s survival mechanisms is the dense resin it secretes, which it uses to bind pieces together or form rudimentary tools on its pseudopods. Scavenger slimes can even vary the conductivity of this resin, allowing them to patch and repair technology. This ability contributes to the scavenger slime\u2019s most iconic feature: durable, snaillike shells each creature fashions from whatever trash it encounters. How these mindless creatures select and shape the components of their shells remains a mystery, but each supports a sophisticated and uniquely evolved life-support system that protects the ooze from vacuum. Most scavenger slimes also incorporate various kitbashed weapons into their shells, making them formidable opponents to even well-equipped adventurers.<br/><br/> Scavenger oozes are the bane of adventurers and treasure hunters exploring ancient ruins and abandoned space stations. Heavily armored and armed, they defend garbage heaps and treasure troves with ferocity, and whatever priceless technology they uncover is quickly disassembled and glued into their shells or incorporated into new weapons.<br/><br/> Their hundreds of eggs\u2014each barely the size of a grain of rice\u2014cling to clothing and boots, allowing them to easily spread to new environments or even starships, where they quietly grow in dark crevices, causing random system failures until the young slimes begin tearing into ship\u2019s vital components. Despite the danger scavenger slimes pose, some creatures find them endlessly delightful. Gremlins find kinship in their destructive nature, while space goblins share the slimes\u2019 habitats and gift for rebuilding technology. Some pirate crews have also learned to seed long-haul freighters with scavenger slime eggs, then follow from a safe distance until the oozes shut down their victims\u2019 defenses.<br/><br/> While the vast majority of scavenger slimes tear down and rebuild technology, a small variant population exists that instead tears down organic beings to \u201cmaintain\u201d them. These rare gene-scavenger slimes construct semiliving shells from bones, hide, and organs of whatever creatures they encounter, incorporating strange special abilities from various aliens and monsters.

Sneaking up on a sharpwing is next to impossible thanks to the sensors covering its sleek body and wings, and while the beast is flying, it almost always sees its prey long before the prey is aware of its presence.<br/><br/> Fortunately for other creatures, these long-ranging hunters typically fly alone. One sharpwing is a dangerous foe, with little preference in the creatures it hunts. A pair can be deadly even to an experienced adventurer, especially if the creatures happen to be defending a nest or a newly hatched keenling, and woe unto the foolish explorer who stumbles the creatures roosting along the edges of an Ice Well crater. Only in lean times will the creatures take to the sky as a group to hunt, but when they do, they have been known to bring down prey several times their size.<br/><br/> Sharpwing breeding season lasts for several months each year, during which an unpaired male sharpwing\u2019s many visual sensors begin to blink rapidly. Biologists believe that this fast blinking signals to unpaired female sharpwings that the male\u2019s sensors are strong and plentiful. In areas where the male sharpwing population is greater than the female population, multiple unpaired males sometimes gather in a circle around a female and spread their wings, trying to showcase as many of their sensors as possible. The female sharpwing then chooses a suitable mate from among the suitors by pecking sharply at his forehead. A sharpwing lays only three or four eggs at a time, and the parents remain paired until all the eggs have hatched, as they both have connections to them after they are laid.<br/><br/> Sharpwing eggs are covered with the same organs that cover a sharpwing\u2019s body, and sharpwing parents have the curious ability to see through those eyes. Many scholars believe this connection is possible due to a genetic form of quantum entanglement the creatures evolved thanks to Aballon\u2019s natural radiation. Others posit that the First Ones are responsible for tinkering with the species\u2019 genetic code millennia ago. In addition, and slightly more puzzling to biologists, is the eggs\u2019 ability to sprout slender legs and flee threats perceived through these same sensors. Such movement is of questionable evolutionary benefit, as it is neither swift nor stealthy and has been known to result in the eggs tumbling down cliffs, sinking into bodies of water, or otherwise ensuring their own destruction.<br/><br/> Sharpwings\u2019 unusual biology provides multitudinous opportunities in arcane, biogenetic, and technological research and development, but it has led to overeager researchers turning to or becoming game hunters. Paying to acquire a sharpwing or one of their eggs is a costly endeavor, and even more so for living specimens. Some entrepreneurs have captured sharpwings to breed them as a commodity, leading to out-of-control invasive populations of the predators on planets far from Aballon. However, they are on the brink of extinction on their home world due to this same increasing demand and the planet\u2019s ever-expanding urban sprawl. This threat to the species (and the threat sharpwings pose to species on other worlds) has drawn the attention of the Xenowardens, and discussion of trade sanctions now threatens to push the breeding, capture, and trade of sharpwings and their eggs into the black market, where it will undoubtedly flourish and possibly hasten the species\u2019 demise."}, "Shobhad Warleader": {"title": "Shobhad Warleader", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 104", "cr": "7", "xp": "3200", "size": "Large", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "monstrous", "creature_subtype": "humanoid", "initiative": "+6", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft.", "perception": "+14", "aura": null, "hp": "105", "rp": null, "eac": "20", "kac": "21", "fort_save": "+9", "ref_save": "+7", "will_save": "+8", "defensive_abilities": "ferocity", "immunities": null, "resistances": "cold 5", "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "50 ft.", "melee": "sintered longsword +17 (2d8+12 S)", "ranged": "shobhad longrifle +14 (2d10+8 P)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "charge attack, fighting styles (blitz)", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+5", "dex": "+2", "con": "+4", "int": "+0", "wis": "+0", "cha": "+2", "skills": "Intimidate +19, Stealth +14, Survival +14", "languages": "Akitonian, Shobhad", "gear": "advanced war harness (functions as d-suit II), sintered longswords (2), shobhad longrifle (functions as an advanced shirren-eye rifle) with 50 sniper rounds", "other_abilities": null, "environment": "cold deserts or mountains (Akiton)", "organization": "solitary, clan (1 plus 20+ shobhads), or moot (2\u20138)", "special_abilities": null, "description": "Collectively called the \u201cshobhad-neh,\u201d the four-armed giants of Akiton live as nomads, much as they have for millennia.

As creatures with no motivations of their own, undead minions can also be found leaderless in the remains of ruined structures on planetary surfaces, adrift in derelict spacecraft, and even floating through the void of space. Whether encountered as servants of a mastermind who coordinates their movements or as a mindless threat in the wake of a cataclysmic disaster, undead minions are always a force to be reckoned with and a scourge to the living.\r\n\r\n Though there are countless types of mindless undead who serve as minions, the most common are cybernetic zombies, occult zombies, and skeletal undead. Both occult zombies and skeletal undead are animated by magical or supernatural forces and created either in dark necromantic rituals (including the \r\n\r\n spell) or by strange and mysterious reactions between the Material and Negative Energy Planes. Cybernetic zombies, on the other hand, arise as the result of technological implants that continue to function after their hosts have died, causing the body to act in a sad, shambling imitation of real life. Without control from an external force, these three kinds of undead simply go through the motions of their former lives, without reason, purpose, or the promise of an end to their miserable existences.\r\n\r\n In the Pact Worlds, most undead hail from the dead world of Eox and were created by the bone sages, though zombies and skeletal creatures are also found among the wreckage of ancient battlefields on Akiton and the enigmatic, alien structures on Aucturn. In contrast, cybernetic zombies are most often found on worlds with high levels of technological development, such as Aballon, Castrovel, and Verces.\r\n\r\n Those cultists of Urgathoa who see undeath as the pinnacle of being surround themselves with undead minions, both to use their abilities to terrorize innocent folk and to study their physiology in order to become undead themselves. While these worshipers would prefer to become more intelligent undead creatures, they often find that their fate is to rise up as a skeleton or zombie. Priests of Pharasma, on the other hand, often go out of their way to destroy all undead creatures, especially their mindless minions.\r\n\r\n Undead minions can be formed from the corpses of any type of creature, though most of those appearing in folklore from across the galaxy are animated versions of whatever culture is telling the tale. Humanoids tell of ambulatory corpses rising from their ritual burial grounds, while aberrations, dragons, and magical beasts have their own legends of mindless dead of their own species returning to plague the living. Whatever the undead creatures\u2019 original form, they often maintain natural attacks and other physical characteristics of their living counterparts even in undeath, though their mindless nature means they lose the ability to carry out complex tactics, conduct intricate or detailed tasks, and cast spells or take other mentally engaging actions.

In addition, it can hustle in such a tunnel for 3 hours each day before it begins to take nonlethal damage.", "description": "Surnochs are burrowing creatures that live in and devour the crusts of asteroids and small moons. Jaws that function like grinders and glands at the bases of their many spines that exude acid to liquefy rock allow these wormlike creatures to create labyrinthine tunnels in their domains, through which they can move with uncanny speed. The color of a surnoch\u2019s hide is similar to that of the rock it burrows through. A typical surnoch is 15 feet long and weighs over 1,200 pounds.<br/><br/> At its leading end, a surnoch has a deep funnel of a mouth lined with numerous small orifices. At the back of the funnel is the grasping jaw with which it brings material into the funnel to be sorted. While the grasping jaw looks ferocious, the real danger of the maw lies in the fact that it is essentially a giant, churning mining machine.<br/><br/> The numerous small orifices that line the interior of a surnoch\u2019s mouth allow matter of different consistencies to stream through as the creature chews and melts its way through rock and stone. Nutrientrich material is routed to the surnoch\u2019s digestive tract, while much of the rest of it is broken down into various acids by the surnoch\u2019s caustrolizer system, a series of organs unique to the creature that act like a chemical factory. A surnoch has an innate sense of which minerals its body requires the most of and has evolved a kind of X-ray vision that it allows it to find these foodstuffs, even through several feet of rock.<br/><br/> After consuming some of its favored elements, a surnoch excretes condensed and hardened forms of the minerals it can neither digest nor turn into acid. A feeding surnoch leaves tunnels full of strange alloys and amalgams in its wake, some which can\u2019t be created through any other process. The castings that line a surnoch tunnel have an ethereal, shimmering beauty, like mother-of-pearl arranged in strange symmetries. Many of the endemic alloys are useful to the technological races of the Pact Worlds, so occasional expeditions purposefully seek out asteroids mined by surnochs to harvest the beasts\u2019 unusual leavings. The greatest connoisseurs of these castings are the sarcesians, who turn the beautiful substances into jewelry and elaborate sculptures.<br/><br/> Approaching surnoch territory to harvest such material, or for any other reason, is incredibly dangerous. Surnochs aren\u2019t territorial but they are ravenous. Almost any technology that can transport a visitor to a surnoch-infested asteroid contains the elements that a surnoch consumes. While powered armor and electronic items are the most likely to draw hungry surnochs, most refined material has a reasonable chance of looking like dinner. Those who make their livings harvesting surnoch castings primarily use equipment created from materials that have already been vetted as uninteresting to the creatures.<br/><br/> Surnochs are found mainly in the asteroids of the Diaspora and in the larger rocks of the Liavaran rings, fully sorting and digesting them before drifting through space to the next host. Surnochs are sometimes seen on small moons across the Pact Worlds, especially the shepherd moons of Liavara, and the discovery of surnoch remains on larger moons has given scientists a fairly precise understanding of how much gravity the beasts can withstand.<br/><br/> A surnoch reproduces once every decade or so, in a process where a smaller creature slowly grows from the surnoch\u2019s hide over the course of a month. This parthenogenesis is often preceded by a period of gorging by the surnoch, which is difficult to differentiate from the creature\u2019s normal voracious feeding behavior. A surnoch feasting in this manner tends to consume minerals with natural radiation (such as uranium), though rocky areas that have been bombarded with nuclear weapons also tend to draw a surnoch ready to reproduce. Once the creature\u2019s bud fully sprouts, it detaches with a burst of acid and the newly formed surnoch is ready to begin feeding. Luckily for the galaxy, at least a third of surnoch parents immediately consume their offspring immediately following this \u201cbirth\u201d for reasons that continue to baffle biologists to this day.<br/><br/> While most surnochs are solitary creatures, two will occasionally travel and feed together, often working their way through parallel tunnels to consume different minerals. While to outsiders it might seem like the two surnochs are deliberately working in concert to cause the most destruction, the truth is far less sinister. The two creatures have been brought together by unknown electromagnetic symbols echoing off their thick hides and attuning their appetites to crave distinct fare. And just as quickly as the pair came together, some mysterious trigger can set them against one another in a tumbling mass of spines and acid that is usually even more devastating than the two surnochs feeding peacefully. A handful of survivors from a recent surnoch attack on a Glimmerglass Inc. production facility in the Diaspora claim that their factory was targeted by a rival company that placed a losing bid for the rights to their asteroid several years before. While their allegations have been dismissed as paranoid ravings, independent investigators found strange computer chips in the brain of what they believe is the corpse of the attacking surnoch."}, "Swarm Corrovox": {"title": "Swarm Corrovox", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 110", "cr": "3", "xp": "800", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "CE", "creature_type": "monstrous", "creature_subtype": "humanoid", "initiative": "+4", "senses": "darkvision 60 ft., blindsense (vibration) 30 ft.", "perception": "+13", "aura": null, "hp": "40", "rp": null, "eac": "14", "kac": "16", "fort_save": "+5", "ref_save": "+7", "will_save": "+4", "defensive_abilities": "swarm mind", "immunities": "acid, fear effects", "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "40 ft., climb 30 ft.", "melee": "claw +9 (1d6+5 S)", "ranged": "acid cannon +12 (1d4+3 A; critical corrode 1d4)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "psychic assault", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+2", "dex": "+4", "con": "+1", "int": "-1", "wis": "+1", "cha": "-3", "skills": "Acrobatics +8, Athletics +8 (+16 when climbing), Stealth +8", "languages": "Shirren; telepathy 100 ft.", "gear": null, "other_abilities": null, "environment": "any", "organization": "solitary, pair, or pack (3-8)", "special_abilities": "<b>Acid Cannon (Ex)</b> A corrovox has an organic acid cannon grafted onto its forearm that can fire blobs of organic acid at a range increment of 40 feet.

While many carbon-based life-forms from other Pact Worlds have since settled there, mining valuable crystals and hunting the silicon predators for their biologically produced superconductors, the world\u2019s crystalline forests and faceted plateaus have also produced their own intelligent races, most notably the famed urogs.<br/><br/> Urog anatomy can be deceptive. When encountered in their everyday or \u201ctraveling mode,\u201d they almost resemble crystalline slugs or snails, their shimmering shell-scales hanging down almost to the ground and hiding their limbs as they float along like hovercrafts on a thin cushion of electromagnetism produced by microscopic cilia. It\u2019s only when they\u2019re in \u201cengagement mode\u201d\u2014whether that means mating, fighting, or interacting directly with other races or their environment\u2014that they rear up and unfold their multiple sets of articulated limbs. While every urog has a powerful beak adorning its head-stalk, this is used solely for fighting and reproduction. Food consumption actually occurs underneath an urog, as it uses the localized electromagnetic effects of its cilia to gradually break molecular bonds and tear tiny pieces off whatever it\u2019s consuming. These \u201cbites\u201d are so microscopic that it\u2019s often hard for other races to even tell what\u2019s happening, with the item in question simply eroding steadily without any obvious markings. Though this allows urogs to eat nearly anything, breaking off and absorbing only the molecules they need and leaving aside the ones they don\u2019t, they prefer the silicon-based plant life of their home. This peculiar method of absorbing nutrients also makes them nearly impossible to poison or drug, as their bodies simply discard any unnecessary ingested molecules.<br/><br/> With plenty of options for food and few predators thanks to their size and sturdy frames, urogs are free to spend most of their time in contemplation. Constantly inspired by the complex geometry of their crystalline world, they wander seemingly at random across the moon\u2019s surface, alone or in loose coalitions, working on mathematical problems or conducting enigmatic experiments. Their languid pace belies their exceedingly sharp intellect; indeed, it is likely because of their laser-like focus on unlocking the galaxy\u2019s most esoteric mathematical and scientific secrets that they can be somewhat slow to react to external stimuli.<br/><br/> Urogs often become single minded in finding the most efficient solution to a problem, spending untold hours just to shave seconds off a given process. This reputation for exactitude has made the crystalline creatures sought-after astrogators, consultants, engineers, and scientists in the Pact Worlds, though most members of other races who work with them acknowledge that such relationships can be challenging, to put it mildly. Though largely friendly\u2014 at least by their own standards\u2014urogs are creatures with little appreciation for social niceties. A bored urog will think nothing of tuning out the person speaking to them or even wandering away entirely, regardless of how powerful the speaker may be, or how potentially life-threatening the matter they\u2019re discussing. Even those who do prove themselves worthy of an urog\u2019s attention must still deal with its brusque personality. Urog emotions are difficult for most other creatures to understand, and resolve primarily around the satisfaction of solving a problem, disappointment at failure, or the excitement of a promising line of inquiry. As such, urogs readily point out mistakes, whether their own or others\u2019. While this is in the interest of improving performance and achieving better results, few humans have the patience and poise to graciously accept an enthusiastic urog\u2019s stream of constant criticism.<br/><br/> Urogs who choose lives of adventure often do so because they believe mathematical and scientific secrets hide in pockets of the galaxy that simply can\u2019t be observed from their limited vantage point on a small moon\u2014and often because they distrust the rigor of the scholarship produced by other species. Urogs who leave Dykon for long periods sometimes suffer an attenuation of their race\u2019s special abilities, likely due to their changed diet and lack of certain electrical fields normally provided by the moon itself. Most successful spacefaring urogs eventually see the value in assisting their less deliberate companions, and they make excellent engineers and science officers on ships that have enough room for the large creatures and their overbearing personas."}, "Verthani Aether Pilot": {"title": "Verthani Aether Pilot", "flavor_text": "Alien Archive pg. 118", "cr": "2", "xp": "600", "size": "Medium", "alignment": "N", "creature_type": "humanoid", "creature_subtype": "verthani", "initiative": "+4", "senses": "low-light vision", "perception": "+8", "aura": null, "hp": "23", "rp": null, "eac": "14", "kac": "15", "fort_save": "+1", "ref_save": "+4", "will_save": "+5", "defensive_abilities": "evasion", "immunities": null, "resistances": null, "weaknesses": null, "spell_resistance": null, "damage_reduction": null, "speed": "30 ft.", "melee": "survival knife +6 (1d4+3 S)", "ranged": "static arc pistol +8 (1d6+2 E; critical arc 2) or tactical shirren-eye rifle +8 (1d10+2 P)", "space": "5 ft.", "reach": "5 ft.", "offensive_abilities": "trick attack +1d4", "spell_like_abilities": null, "spells_known": null, "str": "+1", "dex": "+4", "con": "+1", "int": "+2", "wis": "+1", "cha": "+0", "skills": "Acrobatics +13, Computers +8, Engineering +8, Piloting +16, Stealth +13", "languages": "Common, Vercite", "gear": "estex suit I, static arc pistol with 2 batteries (20 charges each), survival knife, tactical shirren-eye rifle with 20 longarm rounds", "other_abilities": "operative exploits (uncanny pilot), operative specialization (ghost), skin mimic", "environment": "any (Verces)", "organization": "solitary, pair, or squad (3-8)", "special_abilities": "<b>Skin Mimic (Ex)</b> Verthani can manipulate the pigments in their skin at will and with astonishing precision, creating bright decorative patterns or deceptive camouflage.

Their two lower limbs are robust, capable of clinging to jagged surfaces for extended periods, while their forelimbs bear dozens of long, fibrous whiskers that fan out like baleen to catch passing food particles. These forelimbs each also bear a set of three grasping claws, with which a wrikreechee can manipulate objects, tools, and weapons.<br/><br/> Wrikreechees are natives of Akchios, a lonely, watery planet with a fairly eccentric orbit around an orange main-sequence star. Over much of its existence, Akchios was covered in ice miles thick, melting only partly every 3 years when the planet drew closer to the sun. Fairly simple life developed in its concealed oceans, feeding upon nutrients surging from deep-sea vents. Only a modest range of more complex life-forms evolved in the lightless depths, and among these were the wrikreechees: soft-bodied organisms who developed rigid exoskeletons that allowed them to wander and feed during the warming cycle. During the cooling cycle, they molted their shells and retreated into coral-like constructions to conserve energy and socialize with their wintering colony. As best as modern scholars can tell, their kind evolved self-awareness and higher thought processes as a direct extension of this communal living. Though the species developed only rudimentary technologies in the absence of fire and metallurgy, their cultural love of history, mathematics, and philosophy made them a highly educated people.<br/><br/> For the past 100,000 years, Akchios\u2019s sun has grown hotter, melting more and more of the planet\u2019s icy shell. Several centuries before the Gap, Akchios thawed enough to expose its immense ocean, revealing the cosmos to the wrikreechees for the first time. They had already developed complex astronomic theories by the time Pact Worlds explorers arrived 50 years ago, and although the wrikreechees still had only simple tools, they had the academic aptitude to quickly understand and adopt the visitors\u2019 technologies. While still fairly uncommon beyond their home world, traveling wrikreechee scholars and engineers are renowned for creating wonders of architecture and adapting old technologies in innovative ways.<br/><br/> Among the wrikreechees\u2019 most important developments are a swath of pharmaceuticals and inexpensive biotech solutions that have helped them adapt to life in dry environments. Most importantly, these include a series of hormonal enhancements that allow a wrikreechee to maintain its shell year round and a biotech vocal enhancer that helps the creature project its voice and enunciate at near-human levels\u2014 without which a wrikreechee\u2019s simple jaw and throat mangle a range of consonants and can barely project above a whisper in air. Much of the Wrikreechee language is conveyed through arm movements and chirps, with entire syntactic structures expressed solely through vibrations felt only over short distances in the water. These grammatical constructions are reserved primarily for terms of endearment, trust, and understanding.

A cantor velstrac is a fiend that uses its horrific appearance as a weapon.

They are drawn to open interplanar portals and to areas where the barriers between dimensions are weak. Life, especially when coupled with warmth, attracts these creatures like the stench of death attracts carrion birds. The oozes feed on the subtle negative energy surrounding the dying and recently dead, using that energy to reproduce. These creatures can hibernate indefinitely, and they are inured to outer space and airless environments. Because of these traits, void oozes can be found almost anywhere. Explorers have encountered them on planets (habitable or not), asteroids, and spacedocks. The oozes have also been found aboard vessels that have traveled in the darkest regions of space, where the oozes attached themselves to the hull of a passing starship."}}
