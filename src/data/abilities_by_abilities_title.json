At the start of your next turn, you can enter a new stellar mode or stay unattuned.\r\n\r\nAt the end of combat, your stellar mode ends. If you fall unconscious during an encounter, you become unattuned. If you regain consciousness while still under threat, you can enter a stellar mode on your first turn after regaining consciousness, as if it were the first round of combat; if combat ends before you regain consciousness, your stellar mode ends.

Some of your stellar revelations are graviton powers and get stronger if you\u2019re graviton-attuned. While graviton-attuned, you gain a +1 insight bonus to Reflex saves. This bonus increases by 1 for every 9 solarian levels you have.\r\n\r\n### Unattuned\r\nWhile unattuned, you gain no attunement points and you are neither photon-attuned nor graviton-attuned.
